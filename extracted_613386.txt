PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDmON 
Thirty-five years have passed since the KITLV published the first edition 
ofthis grammar ofthe Wolio language. When my Wolio Dictionary (also a 
KITLV publication) appeared in early 1987, the grammar had been out of 
print for many years. Because the dictionary contains numerous cross-
references to the grammar, the fact that the latter was no longer available 
presented a serious problem. Fortunately, this was solved by the decision 
of the board of the KITLV to issue a new edition of the grammar to serve 
as a companion volume to the dictionary. 
At the same time, a new question arose: how to incorporate into the 
second edition new theoretical insights that had led me to change my 
views on several aspects ofthe grammatical structure ofWolio. Incorpor-
ating these changes into the text not only would have necessitated a 
complete rewriting, but would also have meant that the cross-references 
in the dictionary would no longer refer to the proper locations in the 
grammar. I therefore decided to retain the original text, but to add an 
appendix containing the gist of my new insights, especially with re gard to 
the morphology. These additions have been kept as brief as possible. An 
asterisk in the margin ofthe text indicates that an addition can be found 
in the appendix. 
The spelling used in the dictionary is somewhat different from that 
used in the grammar. The differences between the two spelling systems 
are listed below. The motivation for the change in orthography can be 
found in the introduction to the dictionary. 
A number of typographical errors have been corrected in the second 
edition, and a bibliography of works on Wolio language and literature 
has been added. 
I would like to thank the KITLV for undertaking the publication of 
this second edition. And I wish to express my deeply felt gratitude to my 
wife Riet Without her the present book would never have appeared.

SPEUJNG 
In my Wolio dictionary a spelling system is used based on the official 
modern (post-1972) spelling of Indonesian (Ejaan Yang Disempurna-
kan). The differences between that orthography and the one used in this 
book are as follows:

INTRODUCI'lON TO THE FIRST EDmON 
1. 1. 
The W olio language is spoken on the south-west coast of the isle 
of Buton, south-east of Celebes, by the inhabitants of the capital 
Baubau, the residence of the Sultan Kota W olio (a little landinward 
from Baubau), two villages south of Baubau: Meomeo and Bonebone, 
and five villages north of Baubau: Kadolomoko, Kadolokatapi, Waru-
ruma, and Bungi. Besides it is spoken by the inhabitants of Tolandona, 
on the east coast of the isle of .Muna, and the isle commonly known as 
Pulau Makasar (W olio: Liwuto M akasu) 1) Iying between M una and 
Buton. On the northern border of the language area there are two 
villages where Munanese is spoken as weil as Wolio: Lowulowu (on 
Buton) and Baruta (on Muna). 
Outside the proper territory of the language it is spoken by people 
belonging to the nobility (La Ode) living scattered over the country. 
The total number of Wolio speakers does not surpass 25,000. As Wolio 
is of old the official language of the Sultanate, some knowledge of it 
is also found with officials of lower rank (village chiefs etc.) who do 
not belong to the La Ode. To this day Wolio still holds the position 
of official language in this region. 
Wolio belongs to the Indonesian branch of Austronesian 2). In its 
vocabulary it shows many borrowings from cognate languages (esp. 
Malay), from Arabic (of ten evidently with Malay as intermediary), 
Dutch etc. 
From 1936 till 1942 the Wolio language was studied by the govern-
mental Iinguist Dr. E. J. van den Berg. Alas, this scholar was killed in 
1942 during the war on Celebes and all his written material was lost. 
The quarterly reports in which Dr. van den Berg reported progress of 
his researches also contain remarks on W olio. Reading them one gets an 
1) The origin of this name is discussed by E. J van den Berg in C'Ultureel 
Indië vol. I (1939), p. 366. 
2) Thé traditional terminology and division is maintained here, because a 
comprehensive investigation on modern methods into the relationship of these 
languages is still to be done. 
1 
impression of the great quantity of important linguistic material that 
was collected by him but was lost by the violence of the war. 
1. 2. 
Wolio literature consists for the greater part of unwritten 
folk-tales, songs, etc. But there also exists a written literature in 
manuscripts. Of this literature a poem called Kanturuna mohelana (The 
lamp: of the sailor) is best known. 
For writing Wolio, Arabic character is most used, but formerly 
Macassar script seems to have been used also. In recent times the 
modern school-education has propagated the use of Roman character. 
But to people having passed through such schools Roman letters are 
so closely connected with the Malay language that they usually write 
even personal correspondenee in Malay. So it may be said that Wolio 
as a written language is falling into decay. 
1. 3. 
The description is mainly based on the information given by 
La Ode Manarfa, son of the present Sultan, and supplementary infor-
mation given by his wife, Wa Ode Dawia. 
La Ode Manarfa spent the first five years of his life on Buton. 
Then he went to Macassar to go to the elementary school. He stayed 
there during eight years visiting his native country only during holi-
days. During this time he learned Dutch in the school and spoke Malay, 
Macassar and Buginese outside the school. Then he went to Djakarta 
where he visited the Secondary School (A.M.S.). There he very often 
spoke Duteh. When he was 21 years old he went home and stayed there 
during the ]apanese occupation and the first time af ter. During that 
period he mainly spoke Wolio. In the beginning of 1947 he went to 
the Netherlands to study at the University of Leiden. His wife grew 
up in Buton and came to the Netherlands shortly af ter him. She then 
had some knowledge of Malay but learned Dutch only af ter her arrival 
in the Netherlands. 
1. 4. 
The description given here is meant as an account of present-
day W olio. Questions of historicalor comparative linguistics are in 
general left out of discussion or, in some cases, are discussed in the 
notes. 
As this description is meant to be a contribution to linguistic 
knowledge rather than to linguistic theory, very few definitions are 
given so that linguistic terms which are generally accepted (e.g. predi-
cate, subject, etc.) are used without explanation. Certain changes are 
sometimes (esp. in morphology) described in terms of processes, because 
this seemed to be the most practical way of description. 
1. 5. 
The examples are preferably chosen from the texts which are 
2 
added to the description. The material for the greater part of these 
texts was supplied by Mr. Manarfa. Only nrs. XII, XIII, and XV 
were written down at his request by a native c1erk in Arabic character 
with an imperfect Roman transcription added. As the contents range 
from daily conversation to traditional tales, several differences in style 
may be found. 
References to the texts are made iri the description by a Roman 
cipher followed by an Arabic one, p!aced betweert brackets, e.g. (X, 5).

THE PHONEMES 
2. O. 
Since every phoneme shows variations in the way it is actualised 
according to different combinatory positions, the phonemes are des-
cribed in the phonetical characteristics of their centre 3). It may be 
said in general that one of the qualities described may be absent.

3) That the description of the phonemes is made according to their articulatory 
characteristics, is not caused by aversion against the "acoustic" method but by 
the practical impossibility of applying it in the given circumstances. 
4) The term "vocoid" (opp. "non-vocoid") is used here in the phonetical sense. 
In phonemics the terms "vowel" and "consonant" are used.

only and there is no opposition between e.g. mp and a cluster of another 
consonant with p or a cluster consisting of mand another consonant, 
as such clusters do not occur. As to their phonetical characteristics, 
these are easily seen from those of their constituents. It is only to be 
observed that in mb the b has characteristics similar to those of the l}, 
though it lacks the special muscular tension. Likewise d in nd resembles 
rJ without high tension. ml} and ne] do not occur.

An initial vowel of the first word af ter a pause begins with a soft 
initial glide, the vocal cords immediately taking the position of vibration. 
This initial glide, that only occurs in that position, represents a zero 
only in the phonological system.

2. 4. 
In interjections there may occur sounds not belonging to the 
phonological system, viz. yeye! (y a non syllabic voiced high close 
front unrounded vocoid). 
8 
THE WORD 
3. 1. 
Every word contains one or more vowels 5). Each vowel may be 
preceded by one consonant-phoneme or by none. Moreover a word 
always ends with avowel. If a vowel is followed by an identical vowel 
and they are not separated by a consonant, they sound like one vowd 
of nearly double the length. If three identical vowels follow each other 
without a consonant separating them, the length is a little more than 
twice the normal length but triple length is seldom fully actualised. 
These "long vowels" behave in every respect in the same way as two 
(respectively three) different vowels and are accordingly written twice 
(or threefold). According to these rules the vowel-consonant-pattern 
of the word is: vv, evv, vev, evev, evvv, evevv, evevev, 
evvev, vevv, vevev, etc., e.g. eo, tua, uwe, pada, buea, poteo, 
incana, mpearo, alia, atumpu, etc. Exceptions to these rules are found 
in interjections, e.g. sio s -
a cry used in driving away hens. 
3. 2. 
The word is marked by the word-accent. This word-accent 
consists of a high pitch of the penultimate vowel with a faint rising 
contour of the preceding vowels: ána, buéa, 1nawáa, akamekemekémo. 
I f the penultimate and antepenultimate vowels are identical and not 
separated by a consonant, they both have the high pitch: akokariáámo. 
Some loan-words have a different accent: sámala (religious con-
templation), ljUnia (world). 
3. 3. 
In current, fast speech sometimes phonemes are not or scarcely 
pronounced. This may be the case with vowels preceding the penul-
ti mate : in wakutuuna the first u is very short or is elided. With con-
sonants preceding the antepenultimate the same may take place: mapa-
ndapanda and apebaho are sometimes pronounced mapaapanda and 
aebaho 6). 
ó) A restriction of this rule will be discussed in the note to chapter 5. 1. (The 
Phrase), E, 4 (See p. 50). 
~) As eli sion of avowel always occurs before an accent and preferahly in those 
cases in which the pitch is comhined with intensity as usually takes place in 
exc1amatory senten ces, it may he said that the zero is a gradation of the full 
vowel, the shwa-gradation occurring in similar cases in other languages being 
passed over in W:olio. 
9 
MORPHOLOGY 
4. O. 
In this chapter the analysis of words is performed into the 
smallest funetional units 7). These units show a division into two 
groups: 
1. roots whieh may oeeur as wortIs. Elemcnts whieh do not ocel1\' as 
words, but in the same morphologieal positions as roots, arc eallecl 
bound roots 8). 
2. affixes whieh do not oeeur as words but are always combined with 
roots. They always have positions in the word entirely different 
from those oeeupied by roots. 
It follows that eaeh word contains at least on~ root. 
The morphologieal processes are: 
1. 
affixation. The affixes are: 
1. prefixes which are affixed at the beginning of the word befare 
the root. 
2. infix. Wolio has only one infix: -in-. 1t is discussed uncler "The 
Substantive", 4. 3. (1), B, IV. 
3. suffixes whieh are affixed at the end of the word af ter thc root. 
One word may eontain several affixes simultaneously. 
Same roots have a special bound for11l: an allomorph with a final 
consonant whieh appears before a suffix with initia I vowel (suffixes 
-a, -i and -aka). 1t seems impossible to express by a rule which roots 
have a special bound form, or which consonant is the final one of the 
7) It is c1ear that these functional units are the same which are called "mor-
phemes" by L. BIoomfield (Language, 1933, repro 1948 p. 161) and many others. 
These term is avoided here for two reasons : 
1 0 
In discussing a question which is important especially for Indonesian 
Iinguistics C. C. Berg lately proposed the use of the term "morpheme" in a 
somewhat different meaning (see: Bin,qkisGl~ Bttdi, Leiden 1950, p. 27 sqq). 
2 0 
Taking together roots and affixes by one term ignores the fact that they 
are elements of different order, at any rate in many languages. 
8) The term "root" is used here in the sense of "root-morpheme" or "basic 
morpheme'" and not with the special meaning given to it by J. Gonda following 
R. Brandstetter (see: The comparative method as applied to Indonesian lan-
guages, Lingua, I, 1 p. 92-93). 
10 
special bound farm. Only a negative rule can he given: that final con-
sonant is never a prenasalised one.

suffix -i: saroqi. 
root jaga, 
suffix -i: jagani. 
Same roots have a special bound farm hefare one suffix but not bef are 
the other: 
root aba, abaki, but abaaka. 
root taqi, taqisi, but taqiaka. 
root uncura, kauncuramaka, but uncuraaka. 
Same roots occur even before the same suffix in two different forms 
with different meanings. These two different forms may he: 
a. a free farm and a special bound form: 
root rambi, rambiaka and rambitaka. 
root tau, tauaka and tauraka (see: "The Verb", 4. 2. (1), B, 
XIII, c.). 
b. two different special bound farms: 
root gaa, gaati and gaaqi (see: "The Verb", 4. 2. (1), B, XII). 
Il. Reduplication. Reduplication is performed by repeating a form 
(word, stem or root) as far as the second vowel inclusive : 
mboloqa: mbolomboloqa. kalimpopo: kalikalimpopo. baa: baabaa. 
1 f the reduplicated form is a root having only two vowels the word-
accent is also reduplicated: bátubátu, ándiándi. Apart from that the 
general rules of the word-accent also apply: ánáána. 
The various cases of reduplication are discussed under "The Verb" 
(4. 2.) and "The Noun" (4. 3.). One special case of reduplication is 
to be mentioned here. Sometimes proper names are derived from nouns 
by reduplication: 
hoo -
heron, La H oohoo -
Heron. 
kolopua -
tortoise, La Kolokolopua -
Tortoise. 
lIl. Apophony. The only farm of apophony in Wolio occurs only 
in combination with other morphological processes. It consists of repla-
11 
cing a stop by the corresponding nasal-stop-phoneme, e.g. k by qk, 
and is therefore called prenasalisation. Prenasalisation is found: 
a. in combination with certain prefixes: 
sa- + baa: sambaa. me- + kale: meqkole. 
b. in compounds: two words or sterns are united into one (with one 
word-accent!) whereas the initial stop (i f there is one) of the 
second is replaced by the corresponding prenasalized one: penami 
+ kuku: penantiqkuku. ulo + kobulu: Ulouloqkobulu. 
IV. 
Composition. The principle of composition has already been men-
tioned under lIl. A distinction must be made between these "morpho-
logicai" compounds having all the characteristics of one word and those 
compounds in which the constituents keep their own word-accent. The 
latter form a special type of phrase and are therefore discussed under 
"The Phrase" (see: the end of 5. 1. A, 8). 
V. Abbreviation. Abbreviation mainly occurs with proper names in 
vocative. The most common type of abbreviation consists of dropping 
the beginning of the word whereas at least two vowels are retained, 
e.g. W ia for Da'Wia, mauma 9) (dad) probably must be explained as an 
abbreviation of the reduplicated farm of uma (father ). 
Among adult persons names are sometimes abbreviated by drop-
ping all that follows the consonant af ter the first vowel : Man for 
Manarfa; Naf for Nafsahu. 
The various farms are discussed in the following order: 
1. affixes which may be attached to all classes of words, 
2. the verb-forms, 
3. the noun-forms. 
A definition of these two word-classes (verb and noun) can not be 
given here. The morphological and syntactical characteristics of these 
(and other) word-classes will he successively discussed in the following 
part of the description. 
Under "The Verb" and "The Noun" derived farms are discussed 
first. That means a discussion of the re1ation hetween root and sterns. 
Then follow the dec1ension-forms which may be applied to all members 
of the c1ass (declension-forms in general use) or to a group of them 
(dec1ension-forms of limited use) in their formal relation to the sterns. 
9) This is of course no proper name but it is very near to it. It is to be 
remarked here th at in W olio proper names are seldom used, because in many 
cases terms of relationship or official titles are preferred. 
12 
4. 1. AfJixes which may be attached to words of all classes are the suf-
fixes -mo, -po, and -aka1 . Their use and meanings wil! be discussed 
under "Syntax" (see: 5. 1. D, 1.). As to their position it has to be 
remarked that they are always final (after roots and other suffixes), 
the only exception being those cases in which -mo or -po are melted 
together with the object-suffix 3d person of the transitive verb (see: 
4. 2. (2), IJ). 
13 
TIIE VERB 
4. 2. (1). Verb-stems are farms which may have an actor-prefix 
denoting the subject of the verb-form ("action" being taken in the 
sense of "meaning of the verb in generaI"). As to their farm a division 
can he made into: A. underived stems, B. derived stems, C. compound 
stems, D. phrase-stems. They may he divided into: a. transitive stems. 
These may have an object-affix denoting the object of the verb (the 
object being: a complement of the verb less direct than the subject and 
corresponding with the object-affix of an active verb-form or the actor-
prefix of a passive one). b. intransitive verb-stems which have na 
object-affix. 
A. Underived stems consist of roots, e.g. liqka -
to go 10), umba -
to come, karajaa -
to work. 
B. Derived stems consist of a root and one or more affixes. A division 
can he made very well according to these affixes: 
I. 
Prefix ko-. Always intransitive. 
a. The immediate constituent is usually a noun: 
kobulu -
to be hairy, bulu -
hair. 
kobake -
to bear fruit, bake -
fruit. 
kotawa -
to haveleaves, tauu -
leaf. 
kobaju -
to wear a jacket, baju -
jacket. 
kooni -
to speak, oni -
voice. 
This noun may be an underived one (as in the given instances) or a 
derived one: 
kodawua -
to be lucky, dawua -
good luck, dawu -
to give. 
kokariaa -
to hold a feast, kariaa -
feast, riaa -
to be excited 11). 
or a compound: 
10) All examples of verbs are given here in the form of their stems and are 
translated with infinitives. 
11.) As "derivation" is used here in the sense of a more complex formation 
"arising" from a simpier form (the root), the question of possible historical 
priority of the former (as might weil be the case in this instance) remains 
undiscussed, as this question lies beyond the scope of a descriptive grammar. 
14 
* 
konamigara -
to have salty taste, nami -
taste, gara -
salt. 
b. The immediate constituent may he a bound root: 
komeke -
to cough, *meke, cf. kamekemeke -
to cough conti-
nually. 
kokete -
to snigger, *kete, cf. kaketekete -
to snigger continually. 
ko 5aa -
to produce a sound, *5aa, inda ako'aa -
[the new horn 
child] makes no sound. 
c. The immediate constituent mayalso he a verb: 
komiqku -
to move, miqku -
to move (transitive I). 
It must he remarked that among the ko-stems of type a there occur a 
numher of impersonally used verhs (see "the Sentence", 5. 2. (3), 2.) 
denoting meteorological phenomena: 
kokila -
to lighten, kiZa -
lightning. 
kowao -
to rain, wao -
rain. 
koguntu -
to thunder, guntu -
thunder. 
koqalu -
to blow (wind), qalu -
wind. 
koeo -
the sun is shining, eo -
sun. 
II. u. 
Prefix ma-. Forms with prefix ma- are mainly intransitive. 
They all have a root as immediate constituent. In most cases this root 
is a hound one: 
maluntu -
to he lazy. 
makasu -
to he near. 
magasia -
to play. 
l1takakau -
to make preparations. 
nwqau -
to burn. 
In some instances the immediate constituent is a verh : 
maali -
to he expensive, difficult, ali -
to huy. 
mabaho -
to he wet, baho -
to bath. 
l1tanaSu -
to boil, nasu -
to cook. 
masodo -
to he warm, sodo -
to have fever. 
maranca -
to pour down (rain), ranca -
to splash. 
In some other instances it is a noun: 
mawaa -
to be red-hot, waa -
fire. 
maati -
to he shallow, ati -
land, shoal. 
map up u -
to remain, pup u -
remainder. 
magawu -
to he hlue, gawu -
fog. 
maijo -
to he green, ijo -
(the) green. 
matau -
to know, seems to he the only transitive ma-form. 
b. The prefix ma- coincides with substitution of qk for initial k of 
the root in the case of: maqkuru -
to he lean, kuru -
to shrink. 
15 
lIl. Prefix ka-. 
If kamata -
to see (transitive), is to he derived from tnata -
eye, 
it furnishes an example of a verb-stem with prefix ka-. As this 
is the only example found, the existence of such a ka-stem is anything 
but certain. 
IV. a. 
Prefix poma- has the meaning of "at random, on every side, 
without restrictian and without contrai". Verbs with poma- may he 
transitive or intransitive 12). 
pamabebe -
to hit out right and left, be be -
to beat. 
pomasumpu -
to drink without minding what one is drinking, 
sumpu -
to drink. 
potnakande -
to eat at every side, kande -
to eat, cf. XIII, 19 
where it is said of Mankey wildly eating the bananas (the object 
heing mentianed!). 
An example of poma- with a derived stem as immediate constituent: 
pomapotawaiki -
to smile at everybody (intrans. I), pota'U,'aiki -
to smile at. 
b. P0111a- coincides with substitution of qk for initial k of the 
root in: 
pomaqkau -
to scratch one's whole body, kau -
to scratch. 
V. 
ka--a. The verbs having prefix ka- and suffix -a as mutually obliga-
tory affixes are all intransitive and denote "a part of. . .. is subject 
to .... ". They all are derived from roots. 
katembona -
to be partly mouldered, tembo -
to moulder. 
(a-)kailaqa -
some (of it) is gone (XV, 17), ila -
to disappear 
kandawuna -
same parts fall from (it), ndawu -
to fall. 
In these examples the root appears in a special bound form before the 
suffix (see: 4. 0., I). 
VI. Prefix me-. 
Verbs with this prefix are all intransitive and denote a continuous 
action or state. Initials k, c, t, and p of the immediate constituent (root 
or derived stem) are mostly replaced by respectively qk, nc, nt, and mp. 
The immediate constituent may be: 
a. a verb-root: 
12) In genera! it may be said that intransivity occurs in two cases: 
1 0 
where an object is not possib!e or not taken into consideration, 
2 0 
where the object is 50 readily understood without being mentioned or has 
50 genera! a meaning that it may conveniem!y be omitted. 
It is not easy to decide whether the intransitive poma-stems belong to the first 
group or to the second. 
16 
mesumpu -
to drink always, smnptt -
to drink. 
mempili -
to be fastidious, pili -
to choose. 
mentaqi -
to cry always, taqi -
to cry. 
11wqkole -
to sleep always, kole -
to sleep. 
mempeeio -
to be continually looking for something, peelo -
to look for. 
memo,te -
to die continually (e.g. all the chickcns of a hen), 
mate -
to die. 
b. a derived verb-stem: 
memaeka -
to he fearful, maeka -
to fear. 
mempotawa -
to laugh continually, potau-a -
to laugh. 
memaiaqa -
to be constantly high, maiaqa -
to be high. 
c. a noun: 
mendamu -
to chop continually, ndamu -
axe. 
mencarita -
to be fond of talking, carita -
story. 
menjamba -
to go again and again to the lavatory, jamba -
lavatory. 
meracu -
to be a poisoner, racu -
poison. 
Remarkable is the opposition of the two derivations of kande (to eat) : 
the one irregular in form but regular in meaning: 
mekande -
to eat continually, 
and thc other regular in form: meqkande, but having the special 
meaning of "to bite", said of fishes at angling. 
VII. Prefix ti-. 
The general meaning of this prefix seems to be "to get in the state 
of .... ". In the following examples the immediate constituents are 
verbal roots. 
tiumba -
to appear, umba -
to come. 
tidoie -
to lie down, doie -
to lie. 
titigi -
to pour of! (boiled rice), tigi -
to drop. 
The first and second examples are intransitive. As to the third, it is not 
quite certain that titigi is derived from tigi. By its transitivity and 
meaning titigi dif!ers from the other ti-sterns. 
VIII. Prefix ka- with reduplication of the root denotes a continual 
or repeated action. This form is always intransitive. The immediate 
constituent is always a root. This root may be: 
a. a bound root occurring only in this form: 
kagusagusa -
to walk around with much noise. 
kahaahaa -
to be panting. 
kasodesode -
to he sobbing. 
17 
* 
** 
b. bound roots occurring wîth other affixes:

kaboqoboqo -
to be deaf-mute, to he mentally deficient, maboqo 
-
to be deaf. 
c. roots occurring as verb-stems: 
kaliqkaliqka -
to go by foot, liqka -

kalidalida -
to fidget, Ma -
to be restless. 
kahuduhudu -
to be sobbing, hudu -
to hiccough. 
kauncuuncura -
to keep sitting, uncura -
to sit. 
d. roots occurring as nouns: 
kabalebale -
to stand upright, bale -
stake, pole. 
kandokendoke -
to play at tag, ndoke -
monkey. 
IX. Prefix po- and prefix pe- occur in complementary distribution 
and in many cases have similar meaning. Properly speaking i! should 
be necessary to give a complete list of all sterns with po- or pe-. Since 
completeness is not pursued in this description, only some examples are 
given here to show their (rather divergent) meanings. Finally a few 
peculiarities and irregularities are discussed. 
a. Some of these sterns denote bodily states or actions, for the greater 
part involuntary. They all have a bound root as immediate constituent 
and are intransitive. 
potawa -
to laugh. 
pomea -
to yawn. 
pomeke -
to cough. 
poqano -
to swim. 
pelnboi -
to smile. 
pewilu -
to spit. 
b. Much more numerous are those which have a noun-root as 
immediate constituent. These are also intransitive. 
posala -
to wear trousers, sala -
trousers. 
pojao -
to row, jao -
oar. 
posuo -
to stay in the backhouse, suo -
bûckhouse. 
pogunturu -
to fish with poison, gunturu -
fish-poison 13). 
peikane -
to fish, ikane -
fish. 
pepuu -
to begin, PttU -
stem. 
13) Mak, Jav. tuba -
vegetable matter, mostly an extract from the root of 
Derris elliptica, by which fish are stupefied. 
18 
* 
Transitive are: 
potumpo -
to cut through, tumpo -
part, internode. 
penami -
to taste, nami -
taste. 
c. Among those sterns having a verb-stem as immediate constituent 
there is agreat number having the meaning of plurality of the sub-
ject, whereas the object may not be found outside of the group 
denoted by the subject. Accordingly they are intransitive. They all 
have prefix po-; pe- is not found. 
popeelu -
to love one another. 
poewaqi -
to fight against each other. 
pogoraaka -
to caU to each other. 
posala -
to differ from each other. 
d. Other sterns having a verb-stem as immediate constituent have 
special intransitive meaning 14). 
pebaho -
to bathe, baho -
to bath. 
ponamisi -
to suffer, namisi -
to feel. 
potapasi -
to be washing, tapasi -
to wash (things). 
polimba -
to remove, to pass over, limba -
to go out. 
posambure -
to be sweeping, sambure -
to sweep. 
e. Sterns with prefix pe- or po- derived from a noun with prefix ka-
could be cIassified under b but show some peculiarities: 
1. If they are derived from ka-forms corresponding to ma-verbs (I!) 
(see: "The Noun", 4.3. (1), VII, c.), they are transitive anel have 
factitive meaning. 
pekarombu -
to make dirty, karombu -
dirtiness. 
pekaqkilo -
to clean, kaqkilo -
cIeanness. 
pekandaria -
to lessen, to redttce, kanda,ria -
diminution. 
pekapupu -
to use up, kapupu -
rest. 
In this series may be included pekamate -
to kill, as mate -
to 
die, from which kanwte is derived, shares many characteristics 
with the nUl-forms .. 
2. The others follow the general pattern (b.): 
pekabua -
to angle, kabua -
angling-rod. 
pokatanda -
to make a quid, katanda -
quid. 
pokataqe -
to make a bundie, kataqe -
a bundie. 
Pe-derivations from ka-forms have the same appearance as forms with 
prefix peka- (see below uneler X.) but have different meanings anel 
elistribution. 
14) The two cases of intransitivity rnentioned above (note 12) both appear arnong 
these po- (pe-) sterns: pebaho and polimba have a meaning which does not 
admit of an object, the others have so general a meaning that it can be omitted. 
19 
f. Morphological or semantÎc peculiarities are found in the following 
forms: 
Substitution of a prenasalised stop fOr initial stop of the immediate 
constituent in combination with the prefix occurs in: 
peqkeni -
to keep hold of, keni -
to seize. 
pontaqa -
to be halfway, taqa -
middle. 
peq kaadari -
to study (intransitive), kaadari -
instruction. 
The prefix occurs twice in popotawai -
to smile at one another, potawa 
-
to laugh (combination of type a. and c.). 
N oteworthy are the sterns derivated from kemba -
to caU : 
pokemba -
to invite, 
pokembakemba -
to caU to each other, 
pepekemba -
to cause oneself to be invited. 
From kawa -
to come to, two po-forms are derived: 
pokawaaka -
to meet with, to find (transitive), 
pokawakawa -
to come together. 
Pepepeelo, derived from peelo -
to look for, has a causative meaning: 
to make (someone) look for. 
Combination of po- with ti- (see V IJ.) occurs in potiqalu -
to expo se 
oneself to the wind (qalu wind). A form tiqalu does not occur but 
tiqalua -
to be touched by air (things first hermeticaUy packed), 
does occur. 
X. 
Prefix peka-. Forms with prefix peka- are different from pe-stems 
derived from ka-forms (IX, e.) by their meaning and by the fact that 
peka-forms have no corresponding ka-form. 
pekabaqkabaqka -
to go boating, baqka -
boat. 
pekasoo -
to say "aa!", to cry. 
XI. Prefix pa-. Sterns with this prefix have a causative meaning. 
The immediate constituent may be: 
a. a verb-root: 
pakmvi -
to unite in marriage, kawi -
to marry. 
palanto -
to cause to float, lanto -
to float. 
papalai -
to put to flight, palai -
to fly. 
paumba -
to communicate, to say, umba -
to come. 
b. a derived verb-stem: 
papobaju -
to cause (someone) to put on a jacket, pobaju -
to 
wear a jacket. 
patiumba -
to produce, tiumba -
to appear. 
C. a noun. Only one example is found: 
pakaro -
to construct, to build, karo -
body. 
20 
* 
Same pa-farms show a different meaning: 
pasurusuru -
to force, suru -
to want to share in somebody's lot. 
pajere -
to follow, jere -
to pass. 
paaqka -
to be open (gap), aqka -
to lift up. 
XII. Suffix -i. Sterns with suffix -i are all transitive. The suffix 
denotes arelation to the object. This relation is best des cri bed as local. 
The immediate constituent may be: 
a. a verb-root: 
jagani -
to protect, jaga -
to take care. 
k0111pasi -
to climb (a tree), k0111pa -
to climb (intrans.). 
1naisi -
to come to, mai -
to come. 
raqoni -
to obey, raqo -
to listen. 
b. a noun-root: 
batui -
to lapidate, batu -
stone. 
beloki -
to adorn, belo -
ornament. 
suluwi -
to light, sulu -
torch. 
saroqi -
to mean, saro -
name. 
c. a bound root: 
landaki -
to tread upon, polanda -
to step. 
111belai -
to wound, ma111bela -
to he wounded. 
tadami -
to sharpen, matada -
to he sharp. 
aruki -
to work loose (rice from a pot), kaaru -
ladle. 
d. a derived stem: 
popota'lvai -
to smile at each other, potawa -
to laugh. 
potawaiki -
to smile at, shows the peculiarity of having the suffix 
twice with the consonant k in between, as if the final -i is attached 
to a root having a special bound farm with -k 15). 
Reduplication of the root is inherent to the -i-farm in: 
haqahaqai -
to tease, 111ahaqa -
to be naughty. 
busobusoki -
to gorge (food in the mouth), busO' -
to accumulate. 
From the root gaa -
to part, two different -i-farms are derived 
differing in bound farm of the root: gaaqi -
to leave, and gaati -
to as sart, to lay apart. 
XIII. Suffix -aka2• Sterns with suffix -aka2 are all transitive. The 
suffix denotes arelation to the object. This re1ation is different from 
15) This seems a fine proof that the final consonant of such bound forms does 
not need to he a historical remainder of a former stage in which final consonants 
still existed. On the other hand there are cases in which a historical final conso-
nant is retained. This appears from comparison of forms like tadami and taqisi 
with corresponding roots (tajam, taqis and the like) in cognate languages. 
21 
that denoted by suffix -i and very difficult to describe in a formuIa. 
The meaning of the suffix can best be seen from the examples given. 
a. 1. 
When derived from an intransitive stem the -aka2-form implies 
an object: 
ttndaaka -
to approve of, unda -
to agree. 
gaugauaka -
to teIl a lie to, gaugau -
to lie. 
peqkaadariaka -
to study (sornething), peqkaadari -
to study 
(intr.). 
maasiaka -
to love, maasi -
to feel compassion. 
potawaaka -
to laugh at, potawa -
to laugh. 
mendeusaka -
to forbid, mendeu -
to he unwilling. 
taqiaka -
to bewail, taqi -
to weep. 
kokariaaaka -
to hold feast for, kokariaa -
to hold feast. 
2. -aka2-forms derived from a bound root are also transitive : 
romusaka -
to collect, poromuromu -
to come together. 
3. Similar meanings are found with -aka2-forms derived from nouns. 
These are also transitive: 
haejatiaka -
to intend, haejati -
intention. 
* 4. Somewhat different is the case of: 
tumbulaka -
to set in the ground (a plant), to put upside-dowll 
(sorneone), tumbu -
to come up, to spurt up. 
5. Noteworthy is the prefi'x -aka2 with a verb-stem as object denoting 
a simultaneous continual action, e.g. 
liqkaaka ram bi -
to go beating (XIII, 38) 16). 
b. When derived from a transitive verb-stem the effect of the suffix 
-aka2 is: 
1. the meaning of the -aka-stem is different from that of the under-
lying stem: 
keniaka -
to seize hold of, kmi -
to carry, to take in one's 
hands. 
2. the object of the -aka-stem is different from that of the under-
lying stem: 
goraaka -
to call to (somebody ), gora -
to exclaim. 
3. The -aka-stem has two objects of which one is the same as the 
object of the underlying stem. 
pasumpuaka -
to make (somebody) drink (something), pasumpu 
16) That.. in this example the verb-stem rambi is really object óf aliqkaaka, is 
demonstrated by the possible (though somewhat unusual) construction : 0 rambi 
iliqkaakana -
the beating he went with, in which rambi is characterized as a 
noun by 0 and is determined by the passive participle iliqkaak(Jjjfa. 
22 
-- to make (somebody) drink, e.g. pasumpua! -
make him drink I, 
pasumpual?ea uwe! -
make him drink water! (XV, 34). 
The two objects are equivalent in their possibility of construction : 
o mia sii kupasumpuakea uwe -
this man, I make him drink water. 
ouwe sii kupasumpuakea mia -
this water, I make the man 
drink it. 
The most frequent shades of meaning are: 
A. "for, in behaH of, intended for" etc. 
dikaaka -
to place for, in behalf of, dika -
to place. 
dawuaka -
to give to (somebody), dawu -
to give (sornething). 
bacaaka -
to read, recite for (somehady) (VII, 2; VII, 25), baca 
-
to read, to recite. 
B. 
"with, by help of" etc. 
bebeaka -
to hit with (XV, 21), bebe -
to hit. 
tudaaka -
to pelt (somebody) with (something) (XI, 9), tuda -
to throw. 
tambuniaka -
to fill up with (VII, 20), tambttni -
to fill up. 
c. In same sterns a distinction is made between two different meanings 
of the -aka2-form by using or not using a special bound farm, e.g. 
rambitaka -
to make a beating movement with (XV, 13: rambi-
taka karona -
to beat about one's body) (type b. 1), 
rambiaka -
to hit with (XI, 10: rambiakea kau -
to hit him with 
a stick) (type b. 3. B.), to beat for (V, 16: to beat (the drums) for 
(the feast contributions» 
(type b. 3. A.), rambi -
to strike. 
tauraka -
to put down (VI, 9) (type b. 1.), 
tauaka -
to bring down for (XII, 22) (type b. 3. A.), 
tau -
to bring down. 
d. In case of combination of different meanings the suffix -aka2 is 
used twice: 
combination of type b. 1. with type b. 3. B.: 
taanakaaka -
to catch with (XIII, 32), taanaka -
to catch, taa-
to stretch, to put across. 
combination of type a. 2. with type b. 3. A.: 
taburakaaka -
to drop for (XIII, 20), taburaka -
to drop, taburi 
-
to overwhelm. 
The relation between suffix -i and suffix -aka2 is clearly demonstrated 
by those roots showing bath formations, e.g. 
aba -
to ask, abaki -
to ask (somebody), abaaka -
to inquire 
af ter (something). 
23 
taqi -
to weep, taqisi -
to cry over (somebody), taqiaka -
to 
bewail (sornething). 
taburi -
to fall upon, taburalla -
to drop (sornething). 
tutuki -
to pulverize, tutlwka -
to pound in behalf of. 
As the -i-sterns of those roots of which na -aka-sterns occur agree in 
rneaning with the -i-sterns of roots having both farms, and the -aka-
sterns of the roots having na -i-sterns agree in rneaning with the -aka-
sterns of the roots having bath, the opposition between -i- and -aka2 
in general is dear. Besides -i and -a/?a2 are not l11utually exdusive. 
There are same -aka2-forrns c1erived frorn -i-sterns. Frorn the bound 
root *bubu occurring in bubualm -
to cover with, is derived buburi -
to strew upon, and this is the base of buburiaka -
to strew with. 
XIV. Suffix -aka3 • 
The sterns with this suffix are all intransitive. 
The irnl11ediate constituent is either a nurneral or a compound consisting 
of a nUl11eral (junction-forrn) and a nurneral coefficient (see: "The 
Phrase", 5. 1. A. 5.) : 
Siseaka -
to be first, sise -
one. 
ruaaquaka -
to be the second (thing), rua aqu -
two (things). 
limamiaaka -
to be the fifth (man), lima mia -- five (men). 
Frorn the syntactical rules governing the use of the participles (see: 
"The Sentence" , 5. 2. (5).) it is easily understoocl that especially the 
active participle of these sterns occurs: mopatamiaakana -
the fourth 
(man). 
XV. Reduplication. 
By reduplication of the roots of ma-sterns fac-
titive sterns are formed approximating pe-sterns of ka-nouns (IX, e, 1.) 
in rneaning: 
dakidaki -
to ruin, madaki -
to be ugly, bad. 
lapelape -
to put right, malape -
to be right, fine, good. 
romburombu -
to dirty, marombu -
to be dirty. 
As a matter of course these reduplication-sterns are all transitive. 
C. Compound stems consist of two (or possibly more) roots (aften 
with prenasalization of the initial consonant of the second, if there is 
one) together forming one word, e.g. 
penamiqkuku -
to eat little-by-little, penami -
to taste, kuku -
periwinkIe (XIII, 23). 
The example given shows that penamiqkuku is transitive, a dear proof 
that it is an entirely new word. 
D. Phrase-stems are phrases used as verb-stems without losing the 
characteristics of a phrase (more than one word-accent), e.g. 
atalu mia -
there are th ree of thern, talu -
three, mia -
man. 
24 
4. 2. (2). Declension-forms of the verb. 
All formations called dec1ension-forms of the verb are enlargements of 
the sterns. They are characteristic for the verb. 
I. Declension-forms in general usc are those which are possible with 
all sterns. They are: 
a. The actor-prefix es: 
a- third person, aliqka -
he, she, it goes, they go; 
u- second person, uliqka -
you go; 
ku- first pers on singular, Iluliqka -
I go; 
ta- first person plu ral (also second pers on in courteous speech), 
taliqka -
we go. 
b. Prefix be-. The actor-prefixes have their place at the very 
beginning of the form. Only the prefix be- may precede the actor-
prefix. The meaning of this prefix is: future, intention, supposition. 
beaumba -
it wilt come (VI, 1). 
bcakompasimea -
he wanted to c1imb into it (XIII, 16). 
beugaugauaka -
you are prabahly telling lies (XII, 38). 
c. Prefix posa-. If an actian is performed by more than ane person 
together, the prefix of the third person may be combined with a 
prefix posa-. This prefix has its place immediately before the sterns 
af ter the actor-prefix. 
aposaumba -
they come together (V, 6). 
aposapenepene -
they come up together (VII, 17). 
d. Prefix mo-. This_prefix makes active participles and has the 
same place as the actor-prefixes. mo- and the actor-prefixes are 
mutually exc1usive. 
kapala mopolaka -
airplane (flying ship), polaka -
to fly. 
kapala molea -
submarine (diving ship), lea -
to dive. 
This form may have object-affixes (see below) : 
mobacaakea -
reciting for him (VII, 2), bacaaka -
to recite for. 
bel1·wkompasia -
who is to c1imb into it (XIII, 18), kompasi -
to 
climb into. 
molawatia -
receiving him (VII, 12), lawati -
to receive. 
In most cases mo- appears in combination with suffix -na: 
momatena -
dead man (VII, 12), mate -
to be dead. 
momboorena -
remaining (VII, 18), mboore -
to remain. 
mokoonana -
scaly (XV, 94), koona -
to have scales. 
-na always fails to appear with mo-forms having object-affixes and in 
fixed combinations (like kapala mopolaka etc.). 
25 
e. Prefix toi- combined with suffix -akana. This combination of 
affixes forms causative participles: 
toiliqkaakana -
that which causes (someone, something) to go, 
liqka -
to go. 
toimateakana -
cause of death, mate -
to die. 
The prefix mayalso be i- : 
ikobuluakana -
the cause of having feathers (XII, 19), kobulu -
to have feathers. 
f. Prefix sa-. A verb-stem with prefix sa- denotes a fact immedi-
ately preceding 17). The actor is denoted by a "possessive" suffix 
(see helow under "The Noun", 4. 3. (2).). 
saka'Wamami, -
after we had reached (XII, 14), kawa -
to come. 
saraqona -
af ter she had heard (XII, 21), raqo -
to hear. 
samondona -
when they were ready (XII, 28), mondo -
to be 
ready. 
g. Reduplication of the verbstem shows the following division: 
1. Reduplication of the stem. Meaning: intensity, plurality, iteration. 
kupenapenamiqkukupea -
I shall eat them up little-hy-little 
(XIII, 23), stem: penamiqkuku. 
abencibencimo -
she tore up (XV, 29), benci -
to tear. 
apatipatiumba -
he continuously showed (IX, 8), patiumba -
to 
show. 
amapimapii -
they are ill (IV, 11), mapii -
to he ill. 
The meaning of plurality entails frequent comhination with prefix 
posa-. 
aposambulimbulimo -
they all go home (V, 23), mbuli -
to go 
home. 
aposapenepenemo -
they all come up (VII, 17), pene -
to 
come up. 
2. Reduplication of the root. Meaning: weakening, diminution. 
mapiipii -
to be slightly ill, mapii -
to be ill. 
malaqalaqa -
to be rather tall, malaqa -
to he tall. 
poopooli -
to he on the mending hand, pooli -
to he better (a 
sick person). 
abuntubuntulimo -
he trotted (XIV, 11), abuntulimo -
he ran 
(XIV, 9). 
The following forms show irregularities in meaning: 
form 2, meaning 1: 
17) The way in which sa-forms are used will he described later, see 5. 2, (4) b. 
26 
* 
anwkatukatu -
it broke to pieces (XV, 21), makatu -
to break. 
form I, meaning 2: 
masomasodo -
to be rather warm, 11wsodo -
to be hot (but more 
regular: masodosodo -
to be a little feverish). 
As a matter of course the formal distinction between 1 and 2 does not 
exist with root-sterns. 
3. Reduplication of a root may involve a special meaning sa that it 
gets the function of a "secondary" root which implies parallel 
formations of both the reduplicated and the non-reduplicated root. 
gau -
to speak, gaugau -
to lie. 
sumpu -
to drink, sumpusumpu -
to drink spirits in company 18). 
One case does not exclude the other. Besides the special meaning of 
"to drink spirits" (3) sumpusumpu may have the meaning "to drink 
continuously, to a great quantity" (1) (e.g. XIII, 40). 
II. Declension-forms of limited use: 
1. Declension-forms of the transitive verb-stems. 
a. The object-affixes of the transitive verbs are: 
Si.tffixes: -a third person, 
-ko second person singular, 
-komiu second person plural, 
-kami first person plu ral exclusive, 
-aku first pers on singular. 
Prefix: maqa- first person plural inclusive. As to this prefix, it has 
to be remarked that nwqa- has its place immediately bef are the stem 
and after the actor-prefix: ama.qapaali -
he has made us buy 
(XIII, 43) 19). 
The suffix -a has this form only with stems having -i, -e, -0, or -u as 
final vowel. With stems having -a as final vowel the following allo-
morphs appear: 
-w: 1. when the penultimate vowel is not a, 
2. when the penultimate vowel is a not separated from the final 
a by a consonant. 
-ea: When the penultimate vowel is a separated from the final -a by 
a consonant, the final -a is replaced by -ea. -ea also occurs when 
suffix -tnO or -po is used at the same time. The -0 of these suffixes 
is replaced by -ca. 
18) Drinking in pubs (batluana sltmpusumpua) is a common pastime for men in 
Buton, though drunkenness in public is looked at as an infamy. 
19) It must he taken into consideration that maqa- denotes the object of the 
causative verb. The fact that "we" is the actor of the verb "to buy" (ali) does 
not matter. 
27 
taburakaakaaku -
drop for me (XIII, 20), stem: taburakaaka. 
aanuko -
he teases you (XII, 4), stem: anu. 
aabakikomi14 -
he asks you (XV, 75), stem: abaki. 
adawukami -
he has given to us (XV, 81), stem: dawu. 
arno,qapaali -
he makes us buy (XIII, 43), stem: paali. 
beamataua -
he will know it (XIV, 26), stem: matau. 
apotttmpoa -
they cut it (XIII, 5), stem: potumpo. 
ukandea -
you eat it (XV, 25), stem: kande. 
asaroqia -
he supposes it (XIV, 44), stem: saroqi. 
aparahatikaia -
he takes notice of it (XIV, 40), stem: parahatika. 
kupapesuaia -
I make him enter (XII, 41), stem: papesua. 
asikisaaia -
he punishes her (XV, 23), stem: sikisaa. 
kukarno,tea -
I see them (XIV, 23), stem: kamata. 
apajeremea -
he followed him (XIV, 42), stem: pajere + -mo. 
kupenami,qkukttpea -
I shall eat them up little-by-little (XIII, 23), 
stem: penamiqkuku + -po. 
b. A passive participle is formed with prefix i- which has the same 
place as the actor-prefix. The actor may he denoted by a possessive 
suffix (see helow: 4. 3. (2), a.). 
tabako itaqe -
cigarette (wrapped tobacco), taqe -
to wrap. 
beikarajaa -
that which will be done (V, 3), karajaa -
to do, 
to work. 
ikamatamu -
seen by you, karno,ta -
to see. 
ikandena -
eaten by them (I, 3), kande -
to eat. 
c. A passive verb-stem is formed with prefix to- which has its place 
immediately before the verb-stem and af ter the "actor-prefix". 
This "actor-prefix" 20) denotes what would be the object of the 
active verb-stem. What would be the actor of the corresponding 
active stem is never mentioned. The stems with prefix to- are 
treated as ordinary verb-stems, so they may have the actor-prefixes 
and other declension-forms in general use. 
atopambuli -
they are sent home (V, 20), pambuli -
to send home. 
atopaajo -
they are attired (V, 19), paajo -
to attire. 
atobawa -
they are brought (V, 19), bawa -
to bring. 
motopaisilamuna -
being circumcised (V, 14), paisilamu -
to 
circumcise. 
The distinction between the i- and the moto-participle consists in the 
possibility of mentioning the actor with the i-form and the impossibility 
of doing so with the moto-form. 
20) Placed between quotation-marks because of the difficulty of the terminology. 
28 
* 
Some to-stems occur which do not correspond to transitive verb-stems 
but are derived from nouns. They denote involuntary actions. 
atorampe -
he was washed ashore (XII, 33), rampe -
flotsam 
(XIII,3). 
tota1i -
to discharge, taSi -
faeces. 
tole' e -
to urinate, Ie S e -
urine. 
d. A passive potential particiPle is formed with prefix toi- which has 
the same place as the actor-prefixes have, e.g. 
toikarajaa -
what can be made, is to be made, karajaa -
to make. 
2. The ma-sterns and some root-sterns have a special form with 
suffix -aka4 with comparative meaning: 
maoge -
to be great, maogeaka -
to be greater. 
matau -
to know, matauaka -
to know more, better. 
mandaria -
to be little, mandariaaka -
to be less. 
cilaka -
to be unlucky, cilakaaka -
to be more unlucky.

TIIE NOUN 
4. 3. (1). The noun may be: A. a root, B. a derivation, C. a com-
pound. The compounds and the greater entities which have the syntac-
tical functions of nouns are discussed under "Syntax". 
A. 
Roots. Root-nouns show no peculiarities to be discussed here: 
ndamu -
axe, kau -
wood, mantorosu -
sailor. 
B. Derived nouns show the following classes: 
I. Prefix pe-. The immediate constituent is a root-noun. Only one 
example is Iisted: 
pekumbi -
ulcer, kU111bi -
wound. 
11. 
Prefix peka-. Only one example is found. The immediate con-
stituent is a verb-root: 
pekapoqko -
murderer, poqko -
to murder. 
lIl. Prefix po-. The immediate constituent is a verb-stem: 
pototo -
equilibrium, toto -
to be right. 
poabaaka -
kinsman of uncertain remove, abaaka -
to ask for. 
IV. 
Infix -in- is found in a few nouns only: 
kinande -
food, meal, kande -
to eat. 
tinauraka -
heritage, tauraka -
to leave behind, to put down. 
As shown here the immediate constituent is a verb-stem and the infix 
is inserted before the first vowel of this stem. 
V. 
Prefix pino- occurs in terms of kinship only: 
pinomna -
uncle, ama -
father. 
pinoina -
aunt, ina -
mother. 
Pinoana -
nephew, niece, ana -
chiId. 
pinoopua -
great-uncle, great-aunt, opua -
grandfather, grand-
mother 21). 
VI. 
Prefix tope-. Some terms of kinship are derivated from numerals 
to which the prefix tope- is added with prenasalization of the initiaI 
consonant (if there is one). 
21) Comparison with other lndonesian languages makes it probable that pino-
has evolved from combination of prefix po- and infix -m- (cf. Old-Javanese: 
paman and penan). But from a synchronical point of view it can not be split up. 
30 
* 
topentalu -
third cousin, talu -
three. 
topeapa -
fourth cousin, apa -
four. 
Irregular is: topendua -
second cousin, jua (or rua) -
two. 
VII. Prefix ka-. Most nouns with prefix ka- are derived from verb-
sterns. The best way to classify them seems to be the following: 
a. ka-forms derived from root-sterns: 
kagagari -
counting-frame, gagari -
to count. 
kabari -
number, quantity, bari -
to be many, much. 
kasambure -
broom, sambure -
to sweep. 
kataqkesi -
shield, taqkesi -
to ward off. 
b. ka-forms derived from derived sterns: 
kapadola -
instrument to hold out, padola -
to hold out, dola -
to jut out. 
kasuluwi -
instrument to light, suluwi -
to light, sulu -
torch. 
c. ka-forms corresponding with verb-stems with prefix ma- are 
derived from the roots of these ma-sterns so that it may be said 
that ma- is. replaced by lw-. They have for the greater part the 
meaning of verbal substantives. 
kapii -
ilIness, mapii -
to be ill. 
kaputi -
whiteness, maputi -
to be white. 
kasodo -
warmth, masodo -
to be warm. 
kaliqu -
forgetfulness, maliqu -
to forget. 
But other meanings also occur: 
kapasa -
sherd, mapasa -
to be broken. 
kaboqo -
ear-drum, maboqo -
to be deaf. 
kakolo -
pickles (but also: sourness), makolo -
to be sour. 
kapupu -
remainder, mapupu -
to be out, to be gone. 
d. The immediate constituent mayalso be another bound root: 
kaaru -
ladle, aruki -
to work loose (rice from a pot). 
e. A solitary instance of a ka- noun derived from a noun is provided 
by kapaso -
wedge of a lathe, paso, nail, peg. 
f. The prefix ka- is combined with reduplication of the root in: 
kaanuanu -
teasing, anu -
to tease. 
kainainawu -
compound (of a house), inawu -
garden. 
kabaabaa -
wig, baa -

g. matuu -
to be dry, to ebb, has two ka-derivations: 
regular: katuu -
dryness, ebb-tide, 
irregular: kamatuu -
shell-fish. 
31 
* 
VIII. Suffix -a. Nouns derived with suffix -a show approximately 
the same shades of meaning as those with prefix ka- (see: VII, a, b). 
Tbe immediate constituent may he: 
a. a verb-root: 
kolema -
sleeping-place, kole -
to sleep. 
kandea -
meal, kan de -
to eat. 
saqoa -
lap, saqo -
to hold on one's lap. 
pakea -
c1othes, pake -
to wear, to put on. 
b. a derived verb-stem: 
pekaperaa -
spittoon, pekapera -
to spit out red spittle, kapera 
-
red betel-spittle. 
posuoa- locking up (of girls), posuo -
to stay in the backhouse, 
suo -
backhouse. 
podawua -
distribution, podawu -
to distribute, dawu -
to give. 
e. a bound root: 
pikira -
thought, pikiri -
to think, to consider. 
d. a noun: 
bulua -
head of hair, bulu -
hair. 
pasola -
axle of a lathe, paso -
nail, peg. 
IX. Prefix ka- combined with suffix -a. The combination of these 
two affixes gives no more new shades of meaning. Again the immediate 
constituent may be: 
a. a verb-root : 
kabaneuleka -
the opposite, reverse, bancule -
to turn (round). 
kalaria - lathe, lari -
to turn. 
kapadaa -
end, last phase, pada -
to be ready, to be at an end. 
kabaria -

to be many, much. 
b. a derived verb-stem: 
kapepuua -
beginning, pepuu -
to begin, puu -
stem. 
kapeqkenisa -
banister, handle, peqkeni -
to keep hold of, keni 
-
to have in one's hand. 
e. a bound root: 
kararea -
bed, bedroom (of a prince), marare -
to sleep (a prince). 
d. a noun: 
kasupia -
tweezers, supi -
pair of tongs. 
As already has been remarked and is shown by the given examples, 
there is no obvious contrast in meaning between the ka-, the -a-, and 
the ka--a-nouns. Only prefix ka- has a peculiar trait in those ka-nouns 
which are connected with ma-verbs (VII, e.). However from some roots 
32 
forms in two of these three groups are derived which show opposition 
in meaning: 
dawua -
fortune, kadawu -
present, dawu -
to give. 
kabari -
numher, quantity, kabaria -
crowd, ban -
to he many, 
much. 
karido -

remoteness, mando -
to he far 
away. 
tootooroa -
sitting, katootooroa -
seat, tootooro -
to sit. 
X. Suffix -aka5 • Only one example is found of this suffix showing 
great resemblance in meaning with suffix -a: 
lwndesaka -
food, kande -
to eat. 
XI. 
Suffix -i. This suffix is found in one noun only: 
buani -
casting-net, bua -
to pull up. 
XII. 
Prefix pe- in combination with suffix -i. Only one instance is 
Iisted: 
peincai -
character, inca -
heart. 
XIII. Prefix ka- combined with suffix -aka. A solitary instance of 
this combination showing again the resemblance of -aka with suffix -a 
already mentioned (see under X) is provided by: 
kauncuramaka -
seat, uncura -
to sit. 
* 
** 
XIV. Reduplication. Nouns formed with reduplication are all derived 
from roots. These roots may be: 
a. nouns: 
ana -
child (offspring), anaana -
chiId (youngster). 
sara -
council, sarasara -
ceremonies. 
kalimpopo -
star, kalikalimpopo -
fire-fly. 
malo -
night, maloWU110 -
morning. 
b. verb-roots: 
lumbu -
to sweII, lumbulumbu -
slobber, boiI. 
hole -
to bake, holehole -
sweeties. 
liqu/iqu -
maze, is derived from a bound root *liqu occurring in 
maliqu -
to forget. 
4. 3. (2). Declension-forms of the noun. 
a. The possessive suffixes. This term, though not fully adequate, 
gives a sufficient indication of the meaning of these suffixes. 
Theyare: 
-na for the third person: balluana -
his, her, their, its house. 
-mu for the second person singular: banuamu -
your house. 
-miu for the second person plural : banuamiu -
your house. 
-ku for the first person singular: banuaku -
my house. 
33 
* 
-ta for the first person plural inclusive (and the second person in 
courteous speech): banuata -
our (your) house. 
-mami for the first person plural exclusive: banuarnami -
our 
house. 
b. Prefix ko- combined with suffix -na has the meaning of an in-
definite possessive: "somebody's": 
kobanuana -
somebody's house. 
lwinawuna -
somebody's garden (XII, 39). 
c. Some nouns have reduplication as an obligatory plural-formation, 
e.g. kampo -
village, kampoka1npo -
villages (II, 6). 
d. More general is the reduplication to form diminutives: 
umala -
river, urnaumala -
brooklet. 
piso -
knife, pisopiso -
small knife. 
ban ua -
house, banubanua -
small house. 
batu -
stone, batubatu -
small stone. 
e. Prefix sa- is the only declension-form of limited use of the 
noun. It occurs with those nouns which are especially used in 
counting and therefore are called numeral coefficients. lts meaning 
is: one. Further particulars are found under "The Phrase", 
5. 1., A, S. 
34 
SYNTAX 
5. O. 
In syntax we may distinguish two fundamental elements: the 
sentenee and the phrase 22). The sentence is more primary than the 
phrase, but for practical reasons it seems more suitable to discuss the 
phrase first. 
THE PHRASE 
5. 1. 
The phrase is a sequence of words marked by a special into-
nation consisting of a rising contour over all the words of the phrase, 
each word having a higher pitch than the preceding one, whereas the 
last word of the phrase has a special phrase-accent. This phrase-accent 
consists of the antepenultimate vowel having a pitch nearly as high 
as the penultimate vowel and sometimes still higher. This phrase-accent 
is of course not audible when the penultimate and antepenultimate 
vowels of the last word of the phrase are identical and not separated by 
a consonant as in such words the antepenultimate vowel always has the 
same high pitch as the penultimate vowel (see "The Word", S. 2.). 
Besides by the phrase-accent, the phrase is marked by the fact that it 
is pronounced as a whole without a pause between the words whereas 
a short pause is normally heard between two phrases. The separate 
words in a phrase are marked by the word-accent only. 
The beginning and the end of phrases may be marked by those words 
which have always an initialor final place in the phrase. These phrase-
initialor phrase-final words will be mentioned bel ow in the discussion 
of the various types of phrases. 
A phrase may consist of one or more than one word. But, though 
phrases of more words are not unusual, it is remarkable that a very high 
percentage of the phrases in Wolio consists of one word only. 
The phrases are discussed here according to six types: A. substantive-
phrases, B. preposition-phrases, C. verb-phrases, under D. are discuss-
l\2) No mention is made here of the word as a syntactical element because it 
always constitutes a phrase or forms part of a phrase. 
35 
ed those elements which occur in different kinds of phrases, E. phrases 
having te, ara or atawa, F. phrases having ne, ka or ~o. 
These types of phrases may consist of one or more than one word. 
Those phrases which never consist of more than one word are not 
discussed here. 
A. Substantive phrases consist of a noun or a pronoun with or without 
an attribute: 
bae -
rice (II, 4). 
opea -
what? (I, 3). 
komiu -
you (XV, 27). 
The attribute may he: 
1. the article o. This article always precedes the substantive. The 
meaning of 0 can not he described as definite or indefinite, its 
function being that of marking the following word (or words) 
as a separate phrase 23). 
o kariaa -
the feast (V, 24). 
o 'AraQu -
an Arab (IX, 1). 
o sii -
this (XII and XIII, title). 
o iaku -
I. 
2. the plural-marker maqa. Maqa has its place immediately before the 
substantive : 
maqa wutitinai -
the relatives (VI, 2). 
1naqa incema -
who (pI.) (VII, 2). 
maqa anaana sii -
these children (XV, 9). 
When 0 is also added it precedes maqa: 
o maqa mia -
the people (VII, 12). 
o maqa hoo -
the herons (XII, 29). 
o maqa buea -
the crocodiles (XIV, 44). 
The use of maqa depends on whether or not the speaker wishes to ex-
press an explicit plural. It fails to appear when the plural is expressed 
in some other way: by numerals and the like, and with personal pro-
nouns which have different forms for singular and plu ral. But the 
personal pronoun 3d person which does not express thc number may in 
case of heing plural appear with (or without) maqa: maqa incia -
they. 
The arbitrariness in thc use of maqa is clearly demonstrated by the 
following example: limana te maqa aena -
his arms and legs (XI, 4). 
When a noun has the possessive suffix 3d person, maqa may be added 
23) There are some exceptions which will he discussed later. 
36 
to denote the meaning of plurality of this 3d person. In that case maqa 
follows the noun, e.g. kapeeluna maqa -..,. their whishes. This also occurs 
with a passive participle: ikandenamaqa -
what is eaten by them 
(I, 3). 
3. a preposition with a substantive: 
o daoa i Baubau -
the market in Baubau (Il, 1). 
maqa mia i Wolio -
the people in Wolio (I, 1). 
boku to incia -
the book for him. 
As these examples show this attribute follows the substantive. 
4. demonstrative words. The demonstrative words are: sii -
this, 
these, humai or sumai, that, those, itu -
that, those (at a greater 
distance). They are always the last word of the phrase. 
o sikola humai -
these schools (IIl, 6). 
maqa mia humai -
those people (Il, 7). 
maqa anaana sii -
these children (XV, 9). 
Sometimes sii or humai is immediately preceded by incia -
he, she, it. 
The meaning is then "above-mentioned". 
o kolo'uma incia sii -
these snails (already mentioned) (X, 3). 
S. a numeral (junction-form). The numeral precedes the noun. This 
noun is one of a special group caUed "numeral coefficients". The 
most important numeral coefficients are: 
mia (man), for human beings, 
(m)baa (head), for animaIs, 
puu (stem), for trees, 
boka (set), for all things having the shape of a dish or bowl, like 
dishes, nut-shells, etc., 
take (sheet), for pieces of paper, leaves, etc .. 
taqe (roll) , for cigarettes etc., 
(m)bali l ( 'd ) 
wala 
~ 
SI e , 
giu (kind), 
mpearo 
~ (' 
) 
l . 
time, 
wu~qa 
taqa (half), 
tumpo (internode), for sugar-cane etc., 
dodo (piece, cut or drawn off), 
ide (piece ), 
aqu (piece), for all kinds of things not belonging to the range of 
other numeral coefficients, 
and all words denoting measures and weights or spaces of time, e.g. : 
37 
kilo (kilometre), 
metere (metre), 
kaki (foot), 
beqke (measure of capacity of -+- 1 litre), 
pikulu (load, -+- 62,5 kg.), 
bau (superficial measure of -+- 7000 012), 
tao (year), 
(m)bula (month), 
eo (day) , 
malo (night, space of 24 hours) , 
!::;; ~ (week). 
'aharji ~ 
As to the form of the numerals the following is to be remarked: 
A special junction-form, differing from the "independent" form which 
always constitutes a separated phrase and is used in counting without 
mentioning the thing which is counted, is only found with: 
2 (independent: jua, junction-form: rua), 
4 (independent: apa, junction-form: pata) , 
6 (independent: 'ana, junction-form: nama). 
The place of "one" in the series of the junction-forms of the numerals 
is taken by the prefix sa- (see 4. 3. (2), e.): 
samia -
one man 24). 
sampearo -
one time. 
This may be preceded by daaqia which makes it indefinite: 
daaqia samia -
a certain man. 
daaqia saaqu wakutuu -
once upon a time (XIII, 1). 
The interrogative numeral pia appears in the same way as the other 
numerals, also when it is preceded by daaqia or ara which gives it an 
indefinite meaning (some, a number of) : 
pia wuliqa -
how many times? (II, 1). 
ara pia mala -
some nights (V, 32). 
daa.qia pia malo -
a few days (XI, 22). 
Ara pia also appears in indirect questions (e.g. XIII, 10). 
Baa, bula, and bali always show prenasalization of the initial consonant 
in this construction : 
24) It is to he remarked that the coefficient and counted object may be 
expressed by one word, as is the case in this example. 
38 
sambali -
one side. 
rua mbaa -
two (animais). 
lima mbula -
five months. 
This is also of ten the case with take, so: satake or santake -
one sheet. 
Pulu -
ten, atu -
hundred, and rewu -
thousand, appear as numeral 
coefficients : 
sapulu -
ten. 
pata atu -
fourhundred. 
nama rewu -
six thousand. 
But these numeral coefficients may precede one of the series mentioned 
above in the same way as the numbers 2-9 : 
saatu tao -
hundred years. 
sapulu miet -
ten men. 
In combinations of numbers of different order the higher units precede 
the lower ones, so the thousands come first, then the hundreds, then 
the tens, and the units last: 
saatu nama pulu saaqu -
161 (pieces). 
Combination of numeral with numeral coefficient and noun in one 
phrase occurs only in those cases in which the number is not emphasized : 
rua aqu banua -
two houses. 
As this seldom is the case when the number is mentioned, the normal 
order is that a phrase contàining the noun precedes and the numeral 
and numeral coefficient follow in a second phrase: 
loka sapuu -
one banana tree (XIII, 4). 
karatasi satake -
one sheet of paper. 
anana rua mia -
their two children (XV, 1). 
A numeral with a numeral coefficient denoting a measure may be folIo-
wed by a noun denoting the kind of measure in question: 
talu pulu kilo karidona -
thirty kilometres in distance (II, 8). 
pitu gusi kabarina -
tubs seven in number (VIII, 1). 
li1na malo kaqeqena -
five days in duration (V, 25). 
Aqu is the only numeral coefficient which never appears without a 
numeral. All other numeral coefficients may occur in the same way as 
other nouns, whereas only baa, bula and bali (and, but not always, take) 
show the difference between prenasalized and not prenasalized form. 
6. Repetition of a numeral coefficient with prefix sa- constitutes a 
special phrase with the meaning of "each .... ". 
saeo saeo -
each day (XIII, 14). 
samia samiet -
everybody (V, 4). 
39 
The coherence of the two words is so great that suffixes are always 
attached to the last one : 
sagiu sagiuna -
each kind of them (II, 4). 
saeo saeomo -
every day (V, 15). 
7. Indefinite numerals : 
maliq" -
all, every, 
sagaia -
all, all kinds of, 
baribaria -
all, each, one and all. 
These three words precede the noun. When it receives more emphasis, 
baribaria may follow it, but then it is a second phrase. 
maliqu hoo -
all herons (XII, 24). 
sagala giu -
all kinds (of things) (II, 4). 
baribaria /oka masasa humai -
all the ripe bananas (XIII, 19). 
maliqu hoo baribaria -
all herons together (XII, 28). 
Although maliqu, sagala, and baribaria have the same place as the 
numerals, they do not share the characteristic of the latter of being 
combinable with the numeral coefficients only. 
8. A second noun. A noun having a noun as attribute precedes this 
attribute and has the suffix -na. The attribute never has the 
artic1e o. 
o bakena loka sumai -
the fruits of this banana (XIII, 24). 
buluna panina -
the feathers of his wings (XII, 22). 
kabat'ina sikola i W olio -
the number of the schools in Wolio 
(II, 4). 
As shown by the examples given the attribute may have its own attri-
bute(s). The attribute never is a personal pronoun because such a 
relation is sufficiently denoted by the possessive suffixes. 
When the attribute is emphasized it constitutes a separate phrase: 
o $umuruna 0 andi -
the age of the youngest (IV, 9). 
o kapepftuana 0 kariaa -
the beginning of the feast (V, 11). 
Tbe suffix -na is missing when the attribute is a name of material : 
banua kau -
a wood built house. 
pau bia -
a parasol of tissue. 
The suffix is also absent from the word pandc in many names of 
professions : 
pande temba -
hunter, rifleman. 
pande ase -
smith. 
Some derived nouns with suffix -a ma)' occur as attribute of a noun 
without the latter having suffix -na: 
kariaa kawia -
wedding feast (V,S). 
40 
banua matea -
hou5e of a deceased person (lit.: house of decease) 
(VII,7). 
Some fixed combinations of nouns also show the absence of suffix -na. 
They may be considered as a kind of compounds as all suffixes are 
attached to the last noun, but both nouns have their own word-accent. 
kapulu kasumbele(na) -
(his) slaughter-knife (XIII, 52). 
bulu muncu( na) -
(his) moustache. 
The meaning of such phrases is usually a special one and in some of 
them an opposition exists with the normal construction with suffix -na 
attached to the first noun: 
qinci mantoa -
eye-tooth (lit.: dog-tooth). 
qincina mantoa -
a dog' s tooth. 
9. A finite verb-form. When the attribute of a noun is a finite verb-
form, this verb-form follows the noun and the noun usually has 
the suffix -na: 
wakutuuna aumbamo -
the time that he came (XI, 22). 
heqgana beawmbamo -
the time that it is about to come (VI, 1). 
But the suffix -na may be lacking: 
haejati apaka'lvi -
the plan to arrange a marriage (V, 2). 
10. A participle. The participle follows the noun: 
mia bemogoraakea -
someone who should call to him (XIII, 34). 
umane moka'lvi -
bridegroom (V, 13). 
ba'lvine ipaka'lvi -
bride (V, 13). 
The participle may have its own attributes: 
kambakamba itobena i dala -
flowers picked along the roadside 
(V,29). 
rampe itauna mawa -
flotsam carried down by the flood (XIII, 3). 
o mia momakidana abaca ara aburi -
people who can read or 
write (111, 1). 
11. an adjective in stem-form 25). The adjective follows the noun: 
o mia mate -
the dead man (VII, 9). 
bia maputi -
a white cloth (VII, 10). 
o saçjati maqeofje -
the old customs (IV, 22). 
12. The negation mincuana26). Mincuana only occurs with substantives. 
25} The adjectives are a sub-c\ass of the verbs. This suh-c\ass consists of the 
verbs having prefix ma- and some root-verbs. Their most striking characteristic 
in distinction to the other verbs is the construction mentioned here: stem-
form as attribute of a noun. This does not mean that adjectives have no parti-
cipies but these participles are only used as nouns: 0 momatena -
the dead 
(man). 
26} The term "negation" is rather arbitrary as the meaning of mincuana is 
negation of the olie in distinction to another, e.g. "not X (but someone else)". 
41 
It precedes the substantive: 
mincuana iaktt -
not I. 
mincuana gala -
not sugar (XIII, 37). 
13. Proper names of people belonging to the middle class may be 
preceded by La (for men) or Wa (for women). These words only 
occur in this position. Proper names of people belonging to the 
nobility may be preceded by La Ode (men) or Wa Ode (women). 
La Ode (Wa Ode) is also used as a noun, to denote people 
belonging to the nobility, e.g. 
kaadarina maqa Wa Ode -
the schooling of the Wa Ode (IV, 34). 
When the article 0 is added it precedes La (or Wa) : 
La Musa 
Musa (Moses). 
o La Musa ! 
o Musa 
o La Ode X.~ 
La Ode X. 
~ Lord X. 
B. 
Preposition-Phrases consist of a preposition and a substantive. The 
most important preposition is i -
in, on, at, to, into, etc. 
i kamali -
to the palace (IX, 9). 
i umala -
to a river (XI, 16). 
When the substantive is one of the personal pronouns of the first 
person plural inclusive and exclusive, or of the second person singular 
and plural which appear in two forms: a longer one: iqkita, iqkami, 
iqkoo, and iqkomiu respectively, and a shorter one: kita, kami, koo, 
and komiu respectively, the shorter form is preferred af ter i: 
i kita -
with us. 
The substantive preceded by a preposition may have its own attributes: 
i maqa kampokmnpo -
in the villages (II, 6). 
i inawuna Ulouloqkobulu -
in the garden of Hairy-Caterpillar 
(XII, 33). 
But the substantive preceded by a preposition never has the article o. 
A preposition-phrase is never aUribute of a substantive as a substantive 
together with a preposition and its substantive is contained in one 
phrase (see "The Substantive-phrase", 3.). The negation of a preposition-
phrase is inda: 
inda i bamtana -
not in his house. 
C. 
A verb-phrase consists of a finite verb-form with or without 
attributes. 
abawamea -
she brought him (XII, 22). 
42 
kumagari -
I am cold (XII, 37). 
ata12emba -
they are punished (IV, 19). 
The attribute may be: 
1. inda and bali (not). These two words never occur with substantives 
(as these have mincuana as negation). 
lnda precedes the verb. It is the negation of a statement. 
inda bekupanamisi -
I would not suffer (XV, 25). 
inda abari -
they are not many (lIl, 2). 
inda atatauraka -
they are not laid down (VI, 9). 
Bali is the negation of a command or a request. It precedes the verb-
form which usually is an imperative. 
bali alaakea -
do not take them (XV, 11). 
balima 27) sapa -
do not come down (XV, 96). 
balima ase -
do not follow (XV, 69). 
But sometimes, in a poli te request, the second person of the verb 
follows boli: 
boli usabu _. please do not jump down (XIII, 28). 
2. maqa. Maqa denotes an explicit plural of the subject. lts place is 
at the very end of the phrase. 
akaliqlwliqka nwqa -
they go by foot (II, 10). 
inda amaqule maqa? -
do they not get tired? (II, 12). 
apeelomo ikane 11U1qa -
they looked for fish (XII, 6). 
anunumo kabencina biana inana SU11U1i 1naqa -
they looked for 
the torn pieces of their mother's sarong (XV, 43). 
3. an adverb. Some adverbs always precede the verb, though not 
necessarily immediately, e.g. 
sadia -
always, 
pada -
already, 
daaqia -
now, it is the case that. ... 28), 
SO -
only, just, 
coba -
just (with an imperative). 
sadia amahaqa -
they are always naughty (IV, 16). 
padamo uka kudikaia -
I have al ready put it again (IX, 10). 
daaqia amakidikidi -
he was small (XII, 2). 
daaqia akeniaka mpuu -
they held very fast (IV, 22). 
27) The suffix -!ma will discussed later. 
28) This adverb must be distinguished from the verb daaqia -
there is, are. 
daaqia pata mia -
there are four (IV, 2). 
daaqia opuamami -
there was an ancestor of ours (VIII, 1). 
This verb daaqia of ten occurs with a te-phrase (see below). 
43 
so aliqkamo -
he just ran (XIV, 10). 
so apancuru. -
he just went on (XII, 47). 
co ba kamatea -
just look at it (XV, 71). 
These adverbs also precede inda: 
sadia inda araqoni -
they are never obedient (IV, 17). 
Other adverbs always follow the verb, e.g. mpttu -
very, dadi -
if 
you dare (with imperative). 
aposalamo mpuu -
he differed greatly (XI, 3). 
akeniaka mpuu -
they heId very fast (IV, 22). 
papesua dadi! -
put in if you dare I (XII, 42). 
4. an object. As a matter of course an object only appears with 
transitive verbs. 
apokawaaka kaadari -
they are taught (IV, 24). 
apeelomo ikane maqa -
they looked for fish (XII, 6). 
As these instances show the object follows the verb. The only exception 
is opea -
what?, which precedes the verb when forming part of the 
same phrase : 
opea apeqkaadariaka! -
what do they study? (IV, 29). 
A personal pronoun never appears as object within the same pl1rase as 
the verb. It is replaced by an object-affix: 
beabawea -
he would take him (XI, 21). 
apaumbamea -
she said to them (XV, 74). 
aalamea -
they took it (XV, 54). 
If the verb allows two objects, one of them is denoted by an object-
affix, the other follows the verb: 
adawttmea pasali -
they give them a festive gift (V, 21). 
atudaakamea batu -
he threw stones at him (XI, 9). 
The object may have its own attributes which are incorporated in the 
verb-phrase : 
anunumo kabencina biana inana sumai maqa -
they looked for 
the torn pieces of their mother's sarong (XV, 43). 
temo aala parewana tanuana inana La Mbatambata -
and he took 
the weaving-Ioom of La Mbatambata's mother (XV, 21). 
5. another finite verb-form. \Vhen a finite verb-form appears as 
attribute of another finite verb-form, the latter precedes and they 
both have the same actor-prefix. 
amendeu asapo -
he refused to go down (XII, 2). 
apeelu beamataua -
he wants to know it (XIV, 26). 
mai sapo! -
do come down! (XII, 45). 
The attribute may have its own attributes: 
44 
apeelu sa dia akande? -
do they always want to eat? (IV, 13). 
amembali asapo i tana -
they may go down to the ground (IV, 24). 
ao.ari amboorcaka i banua -
they usually live at home (IV, 32). 
It must be remarked that attributes of a verb which are separated 
phrases when the verb is predicate (e.g. a preposition-phrase) become 
one phrase together with the verb when this verb is attribute of another 
verb. This makes dear which of the verb-forms is atttibute to the other. 
Attention will be drawn to the same phenomenon with all verbs which 
are not predicate (see bel ow under "The Sentence"). 
When the verb and the attribute are both transitive they both may have 
an object-affix. These two object-affixes denote the same object: 
apadea aalea -
he finished it taking it away, i.e.: he took it all 
(XII,20). 
apadea alwndea -
he finished them eating them, i.e. : he ate them 
all up (XIII, 22). 
The passive participle-construction corresponding with such a phrase 
with two object-affixes shows two participles: 
maqa rindi ipadana uka ikenina maqa mia -
walls which people 
had touched al ready (VIII, 4). 
This construction corresponds with the phrase : apadea uka akenia maqa 
-
they finished them touching them. 
6. A participle, whether as attribute of a noun or used as a substantive, 
may have all attributes of the finite verb. Besides it may have the 
construction of a noun with a noun as attribute (cf. Substantive-
phrases, 8.). 
mokenina kapooli -
the one who held power (XIII, 6). 
sadia ikandena maqa -
what is usually eaten by them (I, 3). 
iasona maqa mia -
what is sold by the people (II, 3). 
In the same way as the verb which is attribute (see above: S.), a parti-
ciple may have attributes within the phrase which are always separate 
phrases with a finite verb-form which is predicate: 
ikandena maqa i nuncana talu mpearo humai -
what is eaten by 
them in these three times (I, 4). 
o mia motnakidana abaca ara aburi -
people who can read or 
write (III, 1). 
o nwqa mia molawatia i kabaloqko humai -
the people who receive 
him in the grave (VII, 12). 
It must beremarked that the negation of the participle even when it 
is used as a substantive always is inda: 
45 
inda ikobu/uakana panina sumai -
what made that he had no 
wing-feathers anymore (XII, 19). 
7. Verb-forms with prefix sa- may have the same attributes within 
the same phrase as the finite verb-forms have. Among these 
attributes there also occur those which are separate phrases with a 
finite verb-form which is predicate: 
sakamatana La N dokendoke -
when he had seen Monkey 
(XII, 35). 
sakawamami i tawo -
when we had reached the sea (XII, 14). 
sakamatana humai -
when he had seen that (IX, 18). 
An attribute consisting of a preposition with a substantive mayalso 
occur as a separate phrase, as is the case in the following example 
where the attribute i banuana follows the phrase containing the sub-
ject of the sa-form. This subject always constitutes a separate phrase 
(see below under "The Sentence"). 
sakawana 0 La N dokendoke i banuilna -
af ter Monkey had come 
home (XII, 13). 
D. Among those elements which occur in different kinds of phrases 
we may distinguish: 
1. the suffixes -mo, -po, and -aka\ 
2. some words of which uka is the most important. 
1. The suffixes -mo, -po and -aka1 are only formally part of the word 
to which they are attached. Semantically they belong to the whole 
phrase in which they appear. They are usually attached to the first 
word of the phrase. 
mopakaronamo galampa -
those who build the galampa (V, 7). 
podomo momarampina i momatena humai -
all close relatives of 
the dead man only (VII, 12). 
indapo mokoonana -
not yet scaly (XV, 94). 
aumbaaka i koquru -
when arrived at the graveyard (VII, 9). 
But some words never have one of these suffixes. The most important 
are: the article 0, the prepositions i and to, and ne -
if, when 29). If 
one of them is the first word of a phrase containing -mo, -po, or -akal, 
the second word of the phrase has the suffix 30) : 
29) These words (and some other) which have only one vowel and usually occur 
at the heginning of a phrase, show some peculiarities which will he discussed 
later. 
30) In this case the word accent is taken as criterion for the word. This way of 
analysis is supported by the fact that there are other examples of -1110 occurring 
with a word that is not thc first of a phrase. 
46 
i apaimo! -
where? (XII, 36). 
o sarosaromo uka -
a cu stom (VI, 7). 
ne akawamo -
when it comes (VI, 1). 
The word so -
only, just, does not have the suffix when it is followed 
by a verb-form: 
so aliqkamo -
he just ran (XIV, 10). 
so abukemo -
it was full (XV, 35). 
so umboombooremo itu -
you just stay here (XV, 27). 
But when followed by a substantive it may have it: 
samo susuna -
only her breasts (XV, 94). 
The suffix -aka1 marks the phrase in which it appears as an attribute of 
the predicate. This phrase may precede the predicate; then its meaning 
is temporal. When it follows the predicate, its meaning is final. 
amambotuaka -
when a decision has been reached (VII, 3). 
abukeaka -
when it is fuIl (VII, 21). 
indaaka amaisia Kabinduboroko -
that it may not be visited by a 
"Pull-throat" (VI, 11). 
As shown by these examples the nucleus of a phrase containing -aka1 
usually is a verb-form. But this not necessary. It mayalso be a pre-
position-phrase. 
i banuaaka -
when (he is) in the house. 
All attributes of the verb-form are part of the same phrase, also those 
which are separate phrases in case of a verb-form being a predicate: 
kawaaka wakutuuna -
when the time has come 31) (VII,6). 
aumbaaka i kol]uru -
when arrived at the graveyard (VII, 9). 
abariaka mia i daoa -
when there were many people at the market 
(IX, 2). 
The suffixes -mo and -po denote some emphasis on the phrase. Accor-
dingly they usually occur as a part of the predicate of a sentence. As 
-mo has a meaning of greater definiteness it often denotes sure, ascer-
tained facts and accordingly it of ten has the meaning "already" , 
whereas -po usuaIly denotes uncertain, future things. An imperative 
with -po means a request; an imperative with -mo denotes a stringent 
commando Combination with inda -
not, gives rise to indamo -
no 
more, and indapo -
not yet. 
saopeamo! -
how many? (IV, 9). 
akambelimbelimo -
he was walking (XIV, 1). 
31) This example shows that when the subject is part of the same phrase, the 
actor-prefix of the 3d person of the verb may be -absent. 
47 
bekumembalimo ikane -
I shall certainly become a fish (XV, 70). 
bolimo ose! -
do not follow! (XV, 69). 
mbulimo! -
do go home! (XV, 70). 
'ltlitipo! -
just come here! 
taburakaakaakupo -
drop for me! (XIII, 20). 
o eopo sii -
only to-day, not until to-day. 
indapo mokoonana -
not yet scaly (XV, 94). 
pia -
how many?, appears in some fixed combinations with -1110: 
i piamo? -
when? (in the past, opp. : naipia? -
when?, in the future ) ; 
i piama itu ~ formerly, in olden times. 
2. uka or duka which often has the meaning "also, again" (but more 
of ten is hard to translate ) is usually the second word of a phrase: 
amapupumo uka -
they are also finished (V, 35). 
himbomo uka humai -
the same (also like that) (1. 7). 
wakutuuna uka humai -
the same time (V, 10). 
But in a phrase beginning with one of the words which never have one 
of the suffixes -mo, -po, or -aka1 (see above onder 1.), uka (or duka) is 
the third word: 
i apaimo duka? -
where? (XII, 36). 
ne aumba uka sampearona -
when he came back next time 
(XI, 21). 
o ndoke11l0 duka moholnttina buluna panina La H oohoo s1t1nai -
the same monkey that pulled out Heron's wing-feathers (XII, 32). 
With a substantive-phrase of type 8 (a noun having a noun as attribute) 
uka follows the attribute, sa it moves one place further back: 
incana humai uka -
in the meantime (IX, 4). 
There seems to be na fixed rule for the use of the allomorph duka for 
uka. Only with tema there seems to he a constant preference for d1tka: 
temo duka -
and also (XV, 26, 61, and 65). 
In some cases the use of uka involves a special meaning: 
sadia uka -
still, sadia -
always. 
samiamiana uka -
a unique man (VIII, 2), samiamiana -
alone, 
single. 
Podo which also occurs in alle kinds of phrases has the meaning 
"evidently, only". It is always phrase-initial and accordingly the phrase-
marker of substantive-phrases 0 is absent af ter podo: 
podomo kajaganina Seetani -
only protections against demons 
(VI, 13). 
podomo momarampina i momatena hU11lai -
close relatives of the 
dead man only (VII, 12). 
48 
podo beugaugauaka -
you are probably only telling lies (XII, 38). 
E. Phrases having te -
and, with, ara -
or, or atawa -
or, as nuc-
leus need a special discussion as they show some peculiarities in their 
syntactical use which distinguish them from other phrases. 
1. When the attribute is a substantive the te-, ara-, or ata-wa-phrase 
is distinguished from a preposition-phrase by the fact that it is 
a separate phrase even when it is the attribute of a substantive: 
biana te bajuna -
her sarong and her jacket (XV, 28). 
Wa Turuqkoleo te La Mbatambata -
Wa Turuqkoleo and La 
Mbatambata (XV, 60). 
A phrase with te, ara, or atawa is the normal termination after a series 
of co-ordinate substantive-phrases: 
apeqkaadariaka baca, bun, tanu, posorumba, pesulasula te Sámala 
-
they learn reading, writing, weaving, sewing, embroidery, and 
contemplation (IV, 35). 
o tandakia, posusua atau-a posuoa -
circumcision, earpiercing, or 
locking up (V, 5). 
Te, ara, and atawa are usually phrase-initial and accordingly 0 is absent 
from the following substantive. 
The negation of a te-phrase having a substantive as attribute is inda, e.g. 
indamo te buluna panina -
not having any more wing-feathers 
(XII, 18). 
Noteworthy is the use of such a te-phrase as attribute of the impersonal 
verb-form daaqia -
there is, are. 
daaqia te haejati apakawi -
there is a, plan to arrange a marriage 
(V, 2). 
daaqia te anata? -
have you any children? (IV, 1). 
daaqiapo te eo -
the sun was still there (IX, 5). 
2. In distinction to a preposition te may have a finite verb-form as 
attribute. This verb-form may have its own attributes within the 
same phrase but also as separate phrases sa that it looks like a 
"subordinated clause". 
te apetandoa i siqkaru -
and a ring is used to lay it on (VI, 6). 
Ara- or ata-wa-phrases having a finite verb-form seldom occur. 
3. The attribute mayalso be a preposition with a substantive, but this 
seems to be the case only when a preposition-phrase precedes: 
i umane moka'wi ara i ba'lvine ipakawi humai -
at the bridegroom's 
or at the bride's (V, 13). 
4. te also occurs without an attribute or with duka only. In this case 
it always has the suffix -mo: 
49 
temo duka -
anti also (XV, 26, 61, anel 65), 
or it is replaced by its allomorph tee 32) (e.g. XI, 13; XIII, 33; 
XV, 45). 
F. 
The last types of phrases to be discussed here are those containing 
ne, ande, ane -
if, when, ka -
then, for, or ko -
and. 
1. The attribute of tie (ane or ande) usually is a finite verb-form 
with its attributes. But it mayalso he another word or combination 
of words which may be predicate of asentence. It may be said that 
the attribute shows the same construction as a sentence (see the 
following chapter) but in its entirety it constitutes one phrase even 
when it contains elements which otherwise constitute separate 
phrases. This phrase always precedes the predicate of the sentence 
ne aka'lWmo wakutuuna -
when the time has come (V, 9). 
ne aumba uka sampearona -
when he came back next time 
(XI, 21). 
ande inda ukandea ntaupo 0 kawolena amamu -
if you had not 
eaten your father's c1eaned fish (XV, 25). 
It is remarkable that a ne-phrase may have a demonstrative word as 
attribute: 
ne pada apcbaho hmnai -
when he had bathed (VIII, 4). 
2. Ka introduces a finite verb-form or a construction resembling a 
sentence. This verb-form or sentence-like construction denotes 
something which follows or which is the reason of that denoted 
by the predicate of the sentence. When ka is followed by such a 
sentence-like construct ion, this construction shows the same com-
position of phrases as the corresponding sentence. Ka is the first 
word of the first phrase of this construction which always comes 
af ter the predicate of the sentence with its attributes. 
3l1) Tt is remarkable that alt the words which have only one vowe\: the artic1e 
0, the prepositions j, and to, te (and), so (only), ko (and), ka (for, then), ne (if 
when), La which precedes proper names of men, and Wa which precedes proper 
names of wamen, usualty appear as the first word of a phrase. They may 
occur in the middle of a phrase (except ko, ka, and ne), when two of them are 
combined (but not alt combinations are really used!) or in those phrases which 
contain elements usualty occurring as separate phrases. But in these farms they 
never are the last word of the phrase and they never constitute a phrase of 
themselves. In those cases they are represented by a form having two (identical) 
vowels instead of one, or have the suffix -mo, e.g. temo (see above). tee occurs 
regulary and so does soo. But the two-vowel-forms of the other especialty occur 
as nouns with the meaning of se\f-denotation: 00 -
the word "ot 0 kaa -
the word "ka". So it is c1ear that words having only one vowel may occur only 
at the beginning or in the middle of a phrase, but never as the last or the only 
word of a phrase. 
50 
ka indapo ambu/i -
{or he had not yet returned (XII, 13). 
ka alagu duka -
then again she sang (XV, 85). 
ka sakawa11'tami i tawo 0 La Hoohoo aliqkamo duka samiamiana 
-
for when we had reached the sea Heron walked off alcme 
(XII, 14). 
3. Phrases with ko always appear at the beginning of a sentence 
which usually is interrogative. They denote a new theme to which 
the discourse passes over in coherence with the preceding. Ko 
always is the first word and its attribute is a substantive with its 
attributes. 
ko 11'taqa bawine -
and the girls (are they taught the same?) 
(IV, 31). 
ko iqkoo -
and you (how many leaves?) (XIII, 12). 
ko ikanemiu itu -
and these fish of yours (where did you get 
them?) (XV, 80). 
THE SENTEN CE 
5. 2. 
The sentence is the maximal linguistic unit of utterance 33). It 
may consist of one or more phrases. The sentence is marked by the 
sentence-accent and, when it consists of more than one phrase, by the 
sentence-intonation. 
5. 2. (1). The sentence-accent always occurs on the last vowel of the 
sentence and has four types: 
1. Low pitch-accent: the pitch of the last vowel is as low as the pitch 
of the first vowel of the sentence. This type of accent is character-
istic for statement-sentences (symbol: 
.). 
apoilimo i taJikuna. -
he looked back (XIV, 6). 
o inana aleamo duka i tawo. -
their mother dived back into the 
sea (XV, 91). 
2. Rising pitch-accent: the pitch of the last vowe1 begins nearly as 
high as the second last vowel but rises sharply. This type is cha-
racteristic for interrogative sentences (symbol : ?). 
inda amap,imapii? -
are they not i11? (IV, 11). 
opeamo ikarajaa? -
what should he do? (XIV, 15). 
3. Level-pitch-accent: the last vowel has the same pitch as the second 
last vowe1 or is slightly lower. This type of accent is character-
istic for exc1amatory sentences (symbol: I). 
33) Of course in W olio, like in other languages, greater entities of utterance are 
found. But these do not show the functional, systematical alld obligatory character 
of the sentence. A greater entity is, from a linguisticpoint of view, only a 
series of senten ces. 
51 
He sabaqka! -
Say comrade! (XIV, 22). 
Pasumpuakea uwe! -
Let him drink water! (XV, 34). 
4. Falling pitch-accent: the pitch of the last vowel begins as high 
(or nearly as high) as the pitch of the second last vowel and then 
slightly faUs. This type indicates that a further sentence is to 
follow. This "suspensive" accent is especially used when a 
quotation follows (symbol: :). 
aabakimo mopebuanina sumai: "/nda ukamata iqkomiu ° bawine 
aliqkaaka taqi i awif" Alawanimo nwpebuanina sumai: "Takamata 
i awi". -
They asked these fishermen : "Did not you yesterday see 
a woman who walked along weeping ?" The fishermen answered: 
"We did see yesterday" (XV, 56-59). 
5. 2. (2). The sentence-intonation is the pitch-relation of the phrases 
constituting the sentence. It has 5 types: 
a. Rising intonation: the pitch of the phrases rises gradually, the 
pitch of each phrase being slightly higher than the pitch of the 
preceding phrase. 
b. Level-rising intonation: the first two or more phrases have the 
same pitch, the foUowing phrases show the rising intonation des-
cribed under a. 
c. Broken intonation: the sentence begins with rising intonation (a) 
but suddenly comes to a stop and af ter a pause it goes on again, 
starting with the same pitch as the first phrase (symbol : ,). 
d. Linked intonation; the intonation is the same as the broken into-
nation (c.) except in the last phrase before the pause which has 
falling pitch on its last vowel (symbol: ,). 
e. Level-intonation: all the phrases have equal (or nearly equal) pitch. 
About the combination of intonation and sentence-accent it may 
be remarked that all combinations occur exa:pt that of level-
intonation with low pitch, rising pitch, and falling pitch-accent. 
It follows that level-intonation only occurs in exclamatory sentences. 
The intonation may be interrupted when a vocative is intercalated. 
The vocative has a relatively low pitch (symbol: ,-,). 
Ko iqkoo, Ndokendoke, pia ntakemof -
and you, Monkey, how 
many leaves? (XIII, 12). 
Coordinate substantive-phrases have similar pitch so that a temporary 
level-intonation is inserted (symbol: ,). As already has been remarked 
(see: 5. 1., E.), such a series of coordinate substantive-phrases is con-
cluded by a te-, atawa-, or ara-phrase with which the original intona-
tion is resumed. 
52 
Apeqkaadariaka baca, buri, tanu, posorumba, pesulasula te $ámala 
-
They leam reading, writing, weaving, sewing, embroidery, and 
contemplation (IV, 35). 
M otandakina, moposusuna ara moposuona apadmno uka ako-
kariacIakea -
They also stop holding feast for those who are 
circumcised, those whose ears are pierced, and those who are 
locked up (V, 24). 
Kariaa padamo atopatantu wakutuuna, incia kananeal1a -i kariaa 
kawia hU1nai daaqia uka 0 tandakia, posusua atawa posuoa -
When the time of the feast has been fixed, usually circumcision, 
ear-piercing or locking up are combined with the weddingfeast 
(V, 5). 
Incidental deviations of intonation are mostly found in exc1amatory 
sentences, e.g.: 
KoJuntuna 0 mia sii! -
How lazy this man is! 
in which the first word has abnormally high pitch combined with 
stress. 
5. 2. (3). A sentence usually contains a predicate which may be a 
substantive-phrase, a preposition-phrase, or a finite verb-form. When 
the predicate is a substantive-phrase or a preposition-phrase, the 
sentence always also contains a subject, whereas in sentences having 
a verb-phrase as predicate the subject is at least indicated by the actor-
prefix. 
The most important exceptions are: 
a. Fragmentary sentences in which elements are "lacking" which 
are sufficiently denoted in a preceding sentence, e.g. an answer 
to a question and the like. 
Santakemo -
One leaf (XIII, 11). 
Mincuana gola, 0 raaI -
1t is no sugar, it is blood! (XIII, 47). 
b. Sentences containing fixed expressions, titles of a story etc. 
Umbe -
Yes. 
A.(li -
I don't know (XII, 14). 
Taqkanapo -
That is all (VII, 28). 
Tulatulana Lowulo'lVU M orikana -
The story of Old-Lowulowu 
(X, title). 
c. Some exclamatory expressions, vocatives, series of phrases used in 
counting, etc. 
Karombuna Ulouloqkobulu ndea! -
How bad Hairy-Caterpillar 
is! (XII, 40). 
He sabaqka! -
Say comrade! (XIV, 22). 
53 
Sambaa, rua 1Ilbaa .... -
One, two .... (XIV, 36). 
A finite verb-form without an actor-prefix occurs in the following 
cases: 
1. Imperatives : 
I qka papesua dadi! -
Come on, put me in, if you dare! (XII, 42). 
Mai sapo, Ulouloqkobulu! -
Do come down, Hairy-Caterpillar 
(XII, 45). 
Taburakaakaakupo sagaa te iaktt, Ndokendoke! -
Drop some for 
me also, Monkey! (XIII, 20). 
2. Impersonal verbs denoting meteorological phenomena etc.: 
Koeo -
The sun is shining. 
Kowao -
It is raining. 
But these verbs mayalso occur with the actor-prefix of the 3d pers on : 
akoeo, akowao, etc., e.g.: 
Daaqia saaqu wakutuu akowao maranca -
Once upon a time it 
was raining very hard (XIII, 1). 
A $amaramo amana, roonamo amalo, kasiimpo ambuli sU1Ilai -
Their father was angry hecause it was evening by the time they 
returned (XV, 100). 
As already has been mentioned (see the note to 5. 1. D.) the actor-
prefix of the 3d person may be absent when the subject is mentioned 
within the same phrase as the verb. But this is never the case when 
this verb is predicate. 
5. 2. (4). When the predicate is the first phrase of the sentence, the 
intonation is rising. But when one or more phrases precede the predi-
cate, the intonation is level-rising, the predicate being the phrase where 
the rising part of the intonation begins. 
It may he said in general that all phrases preceding the predicate are 
slightly emphasized. In fact many attributes which play an important 
role in the meaning of the sentence because of their meaning (which 
may be modal, local, temporal, or the like) always precede the predicate. 
There is no need to list them all here as numerous examples are found 
in the texts. But some of them need a special discussion : 
a. Phrases with ko and phrases with ne, ande, or ane (see 5. 1. P.) 
show the peculiarity of having always falling pitch on their last 
vowel. In interrogative sentences a ne-phrase may follow the 
predicate. This is connected with the preference of such sentences 
for having the predicate as the first phrase. 
Opea ikarajaa, ne daaqia te kau:ia! -
What is done when there is 
a wedding? (V, 1). 
54 
b. A phrase containing a verb-form with prefix sa- usually is the 
first phrase of the sentence. It may be followed by a noun-phrase 
denoting the subject of the sa-form. When this is the case an 
attribute otherwise being a part of the phrase containing the sa-
form may follow in a separate phrase. 
Sabarina 0 ikaneku iaku kumbulimo katauku ara La H oohoo 
ambulimo duka, roonamo indamo kukamatea -When I had much 
fish I returned, for I thought that Heron had perhaps also 
returned as I no longer saw him (XII, 16). 
Satuwuna 0 buluna panina apolakamo La H oohoo ambulimo i 
banuana -
when the feathers of his wings had grown, Heron 
flew back home (XII, 23). 
Sakawana 0 La Ndokendoke i banuana kawa anwkasu amalo, 
amaimo inana La Hoohoo aabaki La Ndokendoke i apaimo La 
H oohoo, ka indapo ambuli -
After Monkey had come home, when 
evening was near, Heron's mother came to ask Monkey where 
Heron was, for he had not yet returned (XII, 13). 
Smnapupuna 0 loka masasa sumai akandea La Ndokendoke 
asabumo i weta marumpurumpuna, lausaka akana i ampa itaana 
La Kolokolopua -
Af ter Monkey had eaten up all the ripe bananas 
he jumped down on the grassy si de and immediately came down 
on to the man-traps set up by Tortoise (XIII, 30). 
As the given examples show the subject of the sa-form is usually men-
tioned when it is not the same as the subject of the sentence. 
c. Sometimes the predicate is preceded by a noun phrase correspon-
ding to the suffix -na attached to the subject following the 
predicate: 
Incana kaadari incia hU1nai abari mpuu 0 waranaana -
The con-
tents of the schooling is very varied (IV, 27). 
o buri Walanda inda abari 1nomakidana -
There are not many 
who know Roman characters (lIl, 2). 
Onina 11wqa mancuana kooni 0 Lowulowu i piamo itu daaqia 
sawuliqa adencu maqa miana -
The old people tell that once upon 
a time people left Lowulowu (X, 1). 
5. 2. (5). As already has been said above the subject of a sentence 
having a verb as predicate is expressed by the actor-prefix of the verb. 
If the subject is mentioned explicitly, it constitutes a separate phrase. 
This phrase usually is a substantive-phrase. 
So umboombooremo itu komiu maasiakea 0 andimu, roonamo iaku 
bekuliqkamo, karana 0 amamiu alabi kawolena te iqkomiu -
You 
55 
stay here, he kind to your brother, for I am going away, because 
your father esteems his c1eaned fish more than you (XV, 27). 
But it mayalso be a verb-form: 
Potalatala adi komiu, mamudaakana amalape kugagarikomiu -
You go and tie next to each other in order that I can count you 
weIl (Htt.: that I-count-you be good) (XIV, 32). 
When the predicate is a substantive-phrase or a preposition-phrase the 
subject is always mentioned (except in fragmentary sentences, see 
5.2. (3), a.). 
When this subject is a participle the sentence usually suggests that the 
chosen predicate stands in strong opposition to another possibility. 
Somo susuna indapo molwonana -
Only her breasts were not 
yet scaly (in distinction to other parts of her body) (XV, 94). 
Taqkanapo sambaa molapana -
Only one escaped (XII, 31). 
o ndokemo duka mohobutina buluna panina La H oohoo sumai 
molapana -
The same monkey that pulled out Heron's wing-
feathers was the one who escaped (XII, 32). 
Accordingly this type of sentence is especially used in interrogative 
sentences, because the essence of the question is preferably expressed 
by the predicate at the very beginning of the sentence. 
Opea sadia ikandena maqar -
What do they usuaIly eat? (I, 3). 
I apai maqa sabaqkamiu, ka inda kukamatear -
Where are your 
comrades, for I don't see them? (XIV, 23). 
Opea ikarajaa nedaaqia te kawiar -
What is done when there 
is a wedding? (V, 1). 
As shown by the examples given the subject usually follows the predi-
cate. But it precedes when it is emphasized even when this emphasis 
is very slight. 
Maka iqkoo umempili -
But you we re fastidious (XV, 41). 
lncia 0 amata alabiaka kawolel1a te iqkita -
Our father esteems 
his c1eaned fish more than us (XV, 42). 
Andiku La Mbatambata, iaku Wa Turuqkoleo -
My brother is 
La Mbatambata, I am Wa Turuqkoleo (XV, 47). 
5. 2. (6). When the predicate is a transitive finite verb-form the 
object may constitute a separate phrase. This phrase usually follows 
the predicate but it precedes when it is emphasized. 
Garaaka ndea, Mbatambata, 0 inata sii abencibencimea 0 biana -
Truly, Mbatambata, there our mother has torn her sarong 
(XV, 39). 
56 
o Wa Turuqkoleo akembaia i sa"ipina -
She called Wa Turuq-
koleo to her side (XV, 24). 
o bajuna abencibencimea dttka -
Her jacket she also tore up 
(XV, 51). 
The emphasis of an object preceding the predicate is stronger than the 
emphasis of a subject in similar position, because an object constituting 
a separate phrase is already slightly emphasizéd even when it follows 
the predicate, as an object without any emphasis is part of the verb-
phrase (see 5. 1. C,4.). 
When subject and object both are mentioned in separate phrases, the 
one which is most emphasized precedes the predicate, the other folbws. 
When neither of them is emphasized they both follow the predicate 
(which then has the greatest emphasis), the subject preceding the object. 
o La Musa abawea 0 boku sii -
La Musa brings this book. 
o bO/lU sii abawea 0 La Musa -
This book La Musa brings. 
Saeona malomalo atambimea Wa Turuqkoleo 0 La Mbatambata, 
aliqkamo apeelo inana -
Next morning Wa Turuqkoleo carried 
La Mbatambata and went to look for her mother (XV, 36). 
Lausakamo aalea amana 0 ikane sumai -
At once their father took 
the fish (XV, 82). 
As shown by the examples the verb usually has the object-suffix when 
the object is mentioned in a separate phrase (cross-reference). But this 
is not always the case. The object-suffix is absent when the object is 
strongly emphasized. 
Taraqo opea? -
What should we have heard? (XIV, 25). 
Akamatamo 0 harimau igauna i saao itu -
He saw the tiger he 
had just tricked (XIV, 7): 
o Wa Tttruqkoleo te La Mbatambata so adawu saide -
To Wa 
Turuqkoleo and La Mbatambata he only gave a little bit (XV, 83): 
The object usually is a substantive-phrase, but it mayalso be a phrase 
showing the same construction as asentence. Such a phrase may begin 
with o. 
I nda amataua i apai apalai -
He did not know where he was 
running (XIV, 10). 
M aqa wutitinai aumbamo aporOmOr01tlU apogauaka naipiamo 0 
kariaa lmmai te opea beikamjaa -
The relatives then gather in a 
meeting and discuss, when the feast will take place and what wilt 
be done (V, 3). 
Aabakimea 0 opea inda ikobuluakana panina sumai -
She asked 
57 
him how it happened that he had no longer any wing-feathers 
(XII, 19). 
5. 2. (7). A sentence may contain a series of phrases which shows 
the structure of a sentence but is in its whole an attribute to the predi-
cate. When such a sentence-like series of phrases precedes the predicate 
it has linked intonation and may be introduced by such words as 
moomini -
although, kawa -
when, baraqkala -
if, etc. 
Amapupu biana, abencibenci11lo bajuna -
When her sarong was 
used up she tore up her jacket (XV, 30). 
So amaqulemo alagu 0 Wa Turuqkoleo, indamo abaqu 0 inana -
Although Wa Turuqkoleo tired herself out with singing, her 
mother did not come up (XV, 102). 
M oomini kukembaia, amendeu aose iaku. -
Although I called him, 
he did not want to come with me (XII, 15). 
Kawa 0 La Kolokolopua aalamo pilita, aalamo puuna -
When 
Tortoise made his choice he took the trunk (XIII, 8). 
Baraqkala aanuko mia, daampo kupapakia -

25. Then they recite the talqïn over it. 
26. Then people all return home. 
27. Sometimes they return to the dead man's house, because a funeral 
meal is held. 
28. That is all. 
VIII. 
1. Once upon a time there was an ancestor of ours who, when he 
bathed, used seven tubs of water. 
2. But he was not an ordinary person. 
3. Af ter he had bathed, his body was like a mirror. 
4. All things which he might touch, were covered for him with white 
cloth, when he had bathed. in order that he would not touch 
railings or waIls which people had touched already. 
5. This is his story. 
IX. The story of a clever Arab. 
1. Once upon a time there was an Arab, a hajji. 
2. When there were many people at the market, he demonstrated 
his cleverness. 
3. When the sun was almost setting, he called the children and then 
told them to look into a bamboo. 
4. In the meantime the sun had set. 
5. When the children looked into the bamboo, they saw that the sun 
was still there. 
6. Consequently the Arab was much discussed and was praised with 
the words: "How'clever he is!" 
7. So the tale also penetrated to the palace. 
8. Now the ruler wondered why that Arab continuously demon-
strated his cleverness in public. 
9. One day that Arab again gathered the children at the market.

10. Af ter the sun had set, he told the children to look into the bamboo 
and said to them: "I have again put the sun into this bamboo". 
11. "Look at this". 
12. The children looked. 
13. But the sun was not to be seen in the bamboo. 
14. So the children said: "But we do not see the sun, but only His 
Majesty ourLord". 
15. The Arab did not believe it. 
16. He also looked. 
17. But he also only saw the same the children had seen. 
18. When he had seen that, he went up to the palace to ask forgi-
veness. 
19. So is his story. 
X. The story of Old-Lowulowu. 
1. The old people teIl that once upon a time people left Lowulowu, 
2. For one day people suddenly left their houses, because they could 
no longer bear staying in their houses as the village was overrun 
by snails. 
3. But these snaiIs did not resem bIe ordinary snails, for they were 
very large. 
4. When they feIl down as they crawled, they penetrated right 
through the roofs of the houses. 
5. So the people we re forced to leave their houses, as they could 
not stand staying in their houses. 
6. They were afraid that those great snails would overwhelm them. 
7. Therefore they went to live in another place. 
8. That is why the people of Lowulowu are teased like this: 
9. The people of Lowulowu are overwhe1med by snails. 
10. This is the story of Old-Lowulowu. 
XI. The story of La Damu Sarina. 
1. Once upon a time there was someone who had a child. 
2. That person was just like all other people. 
3. But this child of his, when it was grown up, differed greatly 
from other children. 
4. His body, his arms and his legs continually increased in length 
and size.

5. His si ze greatly differed from that of the people. 
6. So his father thought: "Indeed, this child of mine is not the same 
as other children. 
7. This child is very big I" 
8. Therefore he did his best that the child should be strong. 
9. Daily he threw stones at him. 
10. He hit him with a stick. 
11. A coconut would break on his head. 
12. Consequently that child no longer feIt these tortures. 
13. And it became known in the palace about him that there was 
someone who was as big aS that. 
14. Theresult was that he was looked for. 
15. He was made a "follower" (a kind of servant of the ruler). 
16. So his lord, when coming to a river, did not get wet, because that 
man carried him on his shoulder. 
17. Because of his length his ruler's feet no longer got wet when they 
crossed. 
18. One day a ship of a Dutchman arrived. 
19. He saw that there was such a big man. 
20. He asked him to go with that Dutchman, because he would go 
travelling with him, as he said, to show him to the people of the 
world. 
21. They agreed that, when he came back next time, he would take 
him with him. 
22. But 10 I, when he came, the giant had died a few days before. 
23. So the Dutchman's plan fell through. 
24. This is his story. 
XII. This is the story of Monkey and Beron. 
1. The beginning was that Monkey invited Heron to go down (to 
the beach) to fish. 
2. Heron answered that he did not want to go down, because he was 
afraid, as he was small. 
3. Monkey said: "Why are you afraid?" 
4. "If anyone would tease you, I shall certainly bite him". 
5. Then Heron agreed to go down to catch fish. 
6. When they had arrived at the sea, they looked for fish. 
7. But however intently Monkey looked for fish, he could not find 
anything.

8. For he walked over the beach with much noise, so that the fishes 
fled away. 
9. But Heron got much fish. 
10. When noon came, Monkey became angry. 
11. He got hold of Heron, then he pulled out his wing-feathers, then 
he took away his fish, then he went home. 
12. But Heron could not return home as the feathers of his wings 
had all been pulled out by Monkey. 
13. After Monkey had come home, when evening was near, Heron's 
mother came to ask Monkey where Heron was, for he had not 
yet return ed. 
14. Monkey answered: "I do not know, for when we had reached 
the sea, Heron walked off alone. 
15. Although I called him, he did not want to come with me. 
16. When I had much fish, I returned, for I thought that Heron had 
perhaps also returned, as I no longer saw him". 
17. When Heron's mother heard that, she flew down to the sea to 
look for her child. 
18. Arrived by the sea she saw Heron standing up, not having any-
more wing-feathers. 
19. She asked him how it happened that he had no longer any wing-
feathers. 
20. Heron answered that Monkey had pulled them out and that 
Monkey had taken away all Heron's fish. 
21. Having heard this Heron's mother grew angry. 
22. She brought Heron into a cave and afterwards she let down food 
to him, until his wing-feathers had grown. 
23. When the feathers of his wings had grown, Heron flew back 
home. 
24. When he had arrived there, all herons discussed inviting all 
monkeys to go boating with them in order to take revenge for 
what Heron had suffered. 
25. Heron went to call Monkey to come boating to go fishing on an 
other island, for there must be a lot of fish there. 
26. Hearing this all monkeys agreed. 
27. They made boats. 
28. When the boats were ready, all monkeys and all herons got in 
together.

29. When the land had disappeared, the herons pecked through the 
caulk of the boats, then all flew away together. 
30. So all monkeys died sinking down into the sea. 
31. Only one escaped. 
32. The same monkey that pulled out Heron's wing-feathers was the 
one who escaped. 
33. He was washed ashore in the garden of Hairy-Caterpillar. 
34. Arrived there Monkey went on land shivering. 
35. When Hairy-Caterpillar had seen Monkey, he went down to wait 
for him, for otherwise he would eat up everything in his garden. 
36. Arrived there he asked him: "Where have you come from, 
Monkey?" 
37. Monkey answered: "I am cold. I have come from Java". 
38. Hairy-Caterpi11ar said: "You are propably only telling lies. 
39. Perhaps you come from eating in somebody's garden". 
40. Monkey became angry and said: "How bad Hairy-Caterpillar is! 
41. If I put him into my nose, he is sure to die!" 
42. Hairy-Caterpillar answered: "Come on, put me in, if you dare!" 
43. Hearing this Monkey put him into his nose. 
44. Immediately Hairy-Caterpillar went on to Monkey's brains, then 
he ate up his brains. 
45. Monkey screamed out: "Do come down, Hairy-Caterpillar! I was 
joking!" 
46. Hairy-Caterpillar did not listen. 
47. He just went on eating his brains. 
48. So Monkey died. 
XIII. This is the story of Monkey and Tortoise. 
1. Once upon a time it was raining very hard. 
2. At the same time there was aflood. 
3. Monkey and Tortoise agreed to go down to wait for flotsam 
carried down by the flood. 
4. When they had arrived at the water, a banana tree was floating 
downstream. 
5. Immediately they took it, then cut it in order to plant it. 
6. Now Monkey was the one who held power. 
7. He took the top, because he thought it would soon bear fruit.

8. When Tortoise made his choice, he took the trunk. 
9. They proceeded to plant their bananas. 
10. Next day Monkey came calling Tortoise asking him, how many 
leaves the banana had he had planted. 
11. Tortoise answered: "One leaf. 
12. And you, Monkey, how many leaves?" 
13. "It is growing a little, it is drooping a littJe. It is growing a little, 
it is drooping a little!" 
14. Each day they called out to each other like this, until Monkey's 
banana died. 
15. Tortoise's banana however bore fruit. 
16. When it was ripe, Tortoise wanted to c1imb into his banana tree. 
17. But he could not. 
18. He went to eall Monkey who was to c1imb into it. 
19. Arrived there Monkey c1imbed, then he ate all the ripe bananas. 
20. Tortoise called: "Drop some for me also, Monkey!" 
21. But Monkey did not drop any for him. 
22. He only dropped the skins, the contents he ate up. 
23. He only answered: "Wait a moment, you! I shall eat them up 
little-by-little" . 
24. So it went on until the fruits of this banana were finished. 
25. So Tortoise fell into a rage. 
26. He went to sharpen man-traps, then he set them in the ground 
beside the banana tree setting them in the grassy plot. 
27. Then he said to Monkey: 
28. "When you jump down, Monkey, do not jump down on to the 
plain, j ump down on to the grassy plot. 
29. For if you jump down on to the plain, you will be barked at by 
the ruler's dogs". 
30. Af ter Monkey had eaten up all the ripe bananas, he jumped down 
on the grassy si de and immediately came down on to the man-
traps set up by Tortoise. 
31. So Monkey died. 
32. Seeing this Tortoise took a bamboo, thcn he collected Monkey's 
blood in it, then he went to sell it. 
33. And the way he called was: "Oh, won't you buy, won't you buy 
sugar? !"

boy and one a girl. 
2. The name of the girl was Wa Turuqkoleo. 
3. The boy was called La Mbatambata. 
4. It came to pass that Wa Turuqkoleo and La Mbatambata's father 
put out bow-nets. 
5. Fish came into these bow-nets. 
6. He took them, then c1eaned them, then he put them in the smoke. 
7. While Turuqkoleo's father went away, he impressed Wa Tu-
ruqkoleo's mother not to take the c1eaned fish. 
8. Wa Turuqkoleo's mother said: 
9. "Who would take it, only these children". 
10. Wa Turuqkoleo's father answered: 
11. "Even for these children you must not take them". 
12. He had not been gone long, when La Mbatambata began to cry 
saying that he wished to eat his father's c1eaned fish. 
13. His mother gave him fish, but he refused. He just cried, beating 
about his body, but he wanted to eat his feather's c1eaned fish. 
14. Seeing this his mother feIt pity for him. She cut off a piece of 
tail for him, then roasted it for him. 
15. Whiie he was eating it up, his father came. 
16. As soon as he saw it, he immediately went to investigate his 
c1eaned fish. 
17. As soon as he noticed some of it was gone, he got angry. 
18. La Mbatambata's mother said: 
19. "The reason I took it for him is that he refused to eat fish, but 
only wanted your c1eaned fish; I took a piece of tail for him, 
as he was beating about his body". 
20. His father onIy answered: "Even if he cries, you must not give 
it to him". 
21. And he took the weaving-Ioom of La Mbatambata's mother, then 
he hit La Mbatambata's mother with it till it broke.

22. La Mbatambata's mother was all covered with bruises and 
wounds. 
23. When that was finished, as soon as he stopped punishing her, she 
called La Mbatambata and suckled him. 
24. She called Wa Turuqkoleo to her side, while she kept weeping 
over them, and said: 
25. "If you had not eaten your father's cleaned fish, I would not 
suffer like this". 
26. She also said to Wa Turuqkoleo: 
27. "You just stay here, be kind to your brother, for I am going 
away, because your father esteems his cleaned fish more, that 
you". 
28. When La Mbatambata was satisfied with sucking, his mother 
took her sarong and her jacket, then she said farewell to both 
her children, then she went away. 
29. Arrived at the gate of the house she tore up her sarong, then 
threw it on the road all along the road, in order that her children 
should see it. 
30. When her sarong was used up, she tore up her jacket. 
31. Just when her jacket was used up, she arrived by the sea. 
32. She loosened her amulet, then laid it on a stone, then she threw 
herself into the sea. 
33. At night La Mbatambata cried all the night for his mother, his 
throat being dry. 
34. Ris father only said to Wa Turuqkoleo: "Let him drink water". 
35. Although his stomach was full, he did not stop crying. 
36. Next morning Wa Turuqkoleo carried La Mbatambata and went 
to look for her mother. 
37. As she went out by the gate of her house, she saw the torn piece5 
of her mother's sarong. 
38. She wept and said: 
39. "Truly, Mbatambata, there our mother has torn her sarong, 
because you were so fastidious in eating yesterday. 
40. If you had not eaten of our father's cleaned fish, our mother 
would not have gone away, we would stilf be with our mother. 
41. But you were fastidious. 
42. Our father esteems his cleaned fish more than us". 
43. They looked for the torn pieces of their mother's sarong and went 
weeping along the whole road.

44. Wa Turuqkoleo went singing and weeping. 
45. And what she sang was: 
46. "Mother Wa Ndiudiu, come, suckle my brother. 
47. My brother is La Mbatambata, I am Wa Turuqkoleo". 
48. When they had been walking for a long time, they also saw 
pieces of her jacket. 
49. Wa Turuqkoleo again said to La Mbatambata: 
50. "There, our mother was naked, she had no more cloths on. 
51. Her jacket she also tore up". 
52. Then they came by the sea. 
53. Arrived by the sea they saw their mother's amulet on a stone. 
54. They took it with them as a souvenir of their mother. 
55. At the same time fishermen we re there. 
56. They asked these fishermen : 
57. "Did not you yesterday see a woman who walked along weeping ?" 
58. The fishermen answered: 
59. "We did see yesterday, but she dived into the sea; she had not 
come up when evening came". 
60. Wa Turuqkoleo and La Mbatambata wept. 
61. And Wa Turuqkoleo again sang the same she had just sung. 
62. When the fishermen had gone away, Wa Turuqkoleo's mother 
emerged from the sea with a bunch of fish. 
63. But the upper side of her feet had scales like a fish. 
64. When she had come, she took La Mbatambata on to her lap, then 
suckled him. 
65. She also wept over him and said to him: 
66. "If you had just eaten, then you would not part from me". 
67. As soon as La Mbatambata was satisfied with sucking, she sent 
him back home with Wa Turuqkoleo and gave them that bunch 
of fish. 
68. Wa Turuqkoleo and La Mbatambata wanted to follow their 
mother, but she refused saying: 
69. "Do not follow me! 
70. You gust go home, for I shall become a fish. 
71. Just look at this! 
72. The top of my feet has already begun to grow scaly". 
73. Wa Turuqkoleo and La Mbatambata returned home carrying 
their bunch of fish with them. 
74. Their mother also said to them:

75. "When your father asks you, tell him that you did not meet me 
and that someone who felt pity gave you this fish". 
76. Then their mother dived inta the sea again. 
77. When they came home their father asked: 
78. "Did you meet your mot her ?" 
79. They answered : "We did not meet her". 
80. "And these fish of yours, where did you get them?" 
81. "A kindhearted person gave them to us there by the seaside". 
82. At once their father took the fish, then he cooked them and then 
ate them up. 
83. To Wa Turuqkoleo and La Mbatambata he only gave a Httle bit. 
84. When night had fallen, La Mbatambata cried again the whole 
night for his mother and his throat was dry. 
85. Next day Wa Turuqkoleo again took along La Mbatambata in 
a cloth and went to the sea; then again she sang: 
86. "Mother Wa Ndiudiu, come, suckle my brather. 
87. My brother is La Mbatambata, I am Wa Turuqkoleo". 
88. When she heard this again, sad to relate!, their mother again 
emerged and again she had a bunch of fish with her. 
89. When she had come, she again suckled La Mbatambata. 
90. When he was satisfied again with sucking, they returned home 
again. 
91. Their mother dived back into the sea. 
92. It was the same thing each day, until seven days had passed. 
93. When the seventh day had come, she was quite scaly. 
94. Only her breasts were not yet, scaly. 
95. At that moment Wa Ndiudiu said: 
96. "Tornorrow you must not come, for I wil! no longer be able to 
come on land. 
97. 
FOT that reason you should just stay until midday, then go home, 
for this will be the last day that we meet each other". 
98. At midday La Mbatambata was satisfied with sucking. 
99. They went back home with their bunch of fish. 
100. Their father was angry, because it was evening by the time they 
returned. 
101. Next day Wa Turuqkoleo and La Mbatambata 
again went to the sea. 
102. Although Wa Turuqkoleo tired hers elf out with singing, her 
mother did not come up, until the sun set,

of their mother had been laid.
